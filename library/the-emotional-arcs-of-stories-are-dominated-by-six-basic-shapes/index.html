(Dated: September 27, 2016)</p><p>Advances in computing power, natural language processing, and digitization of text now make
it possible to study a culture’s evolution through its texts using a “big data” lens. Our ability to
communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct
emotional trajectories and forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the
emotional arcs for a ﬁltered subset of 1,327 stories from Project Gutenberg’s ﬁction collection, we
ﬁnd a set of six core emotional arcs which form the essential building blocks of complex emotional
trajectories. We strengthen our ﬁndings by separately applying Matrix decomposition, supervised
learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the
closest characteristic stories in publication today and ﬁnd that particular emotional arcs enjoy
greater success, as measured by downloads.</p><p>I.</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The power of stories to transfer information and deﬁne
our own existence has been shown time and again [1–
5]. We are fundamentally driven to ﬁnd and tell stories,
likened to Pan Narrans or Homo Narrativus. Stories are
encoded in art, language, and even in the mathematics of
physics: We use equations to represent both simple and
complicated functions that describe our observations of
the real world.
In science, we formalize the ideas that
best ﬁt our experience with principles such as Occam’s
Razor: The simplest story is the one we should trust. We
tend to prefer stories that ﬁt into the molds which are
familiar, and reject narratives that do not align with our
experience [6].</p><p>We seek to better understand stories that are cap-
tured and shared in written form, a medium that since
inception has radically changed how information ﬂows
[7]. Without evolved cues from tone, facial expression, or
body language, written stories are forced to capture the
entire transfer of experience on a page. An often integral
part of a written story is the emotional experience that
is evoked in the reader. Here, we use a simple, robust
sentiment analysis tool to extract the reader-perceived
emotional content of written stories as they unfold on
the page.</p><p>We objectively test aspects of the theories of folk-
loristics [8, 9], speciﬁcally the commonality of core sto-
ries within societal boundaries [4, 10]. A major compo-
nent of folkloristics is the study of society and culture
through literary analysis. This is sometimes referred to
as narratology, which at its core is “a series of events,
real or ﬁctional, presented to the reader or the listener”
[11]. In our present treatment, we consider the plot as
the “backbone” of events that occur in a chronological
sequence (more detail on previous theories of plot are in
Appendix A). While the plot captures the mechanics of
a narrative and the structure encodes their delivery, in
the present work we examine the emotional arc that is</p><p>invoked through the words used. The emotional arc of a
story does not give us direct information about the plot
or the intended meaning of the story, but rather exists as
part of the whole narrative (e.g., an emotional arc show-
ing a fall in sentiment throughout a story may arise from
very diﬀerent plot and structure combinations). This dis-
tinction between the emotional arc and the plot of a story
is one point of misunderstanding in other work that has
drawn criticism from the digital humanities community
[12]. Through the identiﬁcation of motifs [13], narrative
theories [14] allow us to analyze, interpret, describe, and
compare stories across cultures and regions of the world
[15]. We show that automated extraction of emotional
arcs is not only possibly, but can test previous theories
and provide new insights with the potential to quanti-
fy unobserved trends as the ﬁeld transitions from data-
scarce to data-rich [16, 17].</p><p>The rejected master’s thesis of Kurt Vonnegut—which
he personally considered his greatest contribution—
deﬁnes the emotional arc of a story on the “Beginning–
End” and “Ill Fortune–Great Fortune” axes [18]. Von-
negut ﬁnds a remarkable similarity between Cinderella
and the origin story of Christianity in the Old Testa-
ment (see Fig. S1 in Appendix B), leading us to search
for all such groupings. In a recorded lecture available on
YouTube [19], Vonnegut asserted:</p><p>“There is no reason why the simple shapes of
stories can’t be fed into computers, they are
beautiful shapes.”</p><p>For our analysis, we apply three independent tools:
Matrix decomposition by Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD), supervised learning by agglomerative (hierarchi-
cal) clustering with Ward’s method, and unsupervised
learning by a Self Organizing Map (SOM, a type of neu-
ral network). Each tool encompasses diﬀerent strengths:
the SVD ﬁnds the underlying basis of all of the emotion-
al arcs, the clustering classiﬁes the emotional arcs into
distinct groups, and the SOM generates arcs from noise</p><p>which are similar to those in our corpus using a stochas-
tic process. It is only by considering the results of each
tool in support of each other that we are able to conﬁrm
our ﬁndings.</p><p>We proceed as follows. We ﬁrst introduce our methods
in Section II, we then discuss the combined results of each
method in Section III, and we present our conclusions in
Section IV. A graphical outline of the methodology and
results can be found as Fig. S2 in Appendix B.</p><p>II. METHODS</p><p>A. Emotional arc construction</p><p>To generate emotional arcs, we analyze the sentiment
of 10,000 word windows, which we slide through the text
(see Fig. 1). We rate the emotional content of each win-
dow using our Hedonometer with the labMT dataset,
chosen for lexical coverage and its ability to generate
meaningful word shift graphs, speciﬁcally using 10,000
words as a minimum necessary to generate meaningful
sentiment scores [20, 21]. We emphasize that dictionary-
based methods for sentiment analysis usually perform
worse than random on individual sentences [20, 21], and
although this issue can be resolved by using a rolling aver-
age of sentences scores, it begets a basic misunderstand-
ing of similar eﬀorts [12]. In Fig. 2, we show the emotion-
al arc of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the ﬁnal
book in the popular Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling.
While the plot of the book is nested and complicated, the
emotional arc associated with each sub-narrative is clear-
ly visible. We analyze the emotional arcs corresponding
to complete books, and to limit the conﬂation of multiple
core emotional arcs, we restrict our analysis to shorter
books by selecting a maximum number of words when
building our ﬁlter. Further details of the emotional arc
construction can be found in Appendix C.</p><p>B. Project Gutenberg Corpus</p><p>For a suitable corpus we draw on the open access
Project Gutenberg data set [25]. We apply rough ﬁlters
to the collection (roughly 50,000 books) in an attempt to
obtain a set of books that represent English works of ﬁc-
tion. We start by selecting for only English books, with
total words between 20,000 and 100,000, with more than
40 downloads from the Project Gutenberg website, and
with Library of Congress Class corresponding to English
ﬁction[43]. To ensure that the 40-download limit is not
inﬂuencing the results here, we further test each method
for 10, 20, 40, and 80 download thresholds, in each case</p><p>[43] The speciﬁc classes have labels PN, PR, PS, and PZ.</p><p>2</p><p>FIG. 1:
Schematic of how we compute emotional arcs.
The indicated uniform length segments (gap between sam-
ples) taken from the text form the sample with ﬁxed window
size set at Nw = 10, 000 words. The segment length is thus
Ns = (N −(Nw +1))/n for N the length of the book in words,
and n the number of points in the time series. Sliding this
ﬁxed size window through the book, we generate n sentiment
scores with the Hedonometer, which comprise the emotional
arc [22].</p><p>conﬁrming the 40 download ﬁndings to be qualitative-
ly unchanged. Next, we remove books with any word
in the title from a list of keywords (e.g., “poems” and
“collection”, full list in Appendix C). From within this
set of books, we remove the front and back matter of
each book using regular expression pattern matches that
match on 98.9% of the books included. Two slices of
the data for download count and the total word count
are shown in Appendix C Fig. S4. We provide a list
of the book ID’s which are included for download in
the Online Appendices at <a href=http://compstorylab.org/>http://compstorylab.org/</a>

Project Gutenberg ID when we mention a book by title
herein. Given the Project Gutenberg ID n, the raw ebook
is available online from Project Gutenberg at http:

Rowling, inspired by the illustration
made by Medaris for The Why Files [23]. The entire seven book series can be classiﬁed as a “Kill the monster” plot [24],
while the many sub plots and connections between them complicate the emotional arc of each individual book: this plot could
not be readily inferred from the emotional arc alone. The emotional arc shown here, captures the major highs and lows of
the story, and should be familiar to any reader well acquainted with Harry Potter. Our method does not pick up emotional
moments discussed brieﬂy, perhaps in one paragraph or sentence (e.g., the ﬁrst kiss of Harry and Ginny). We provide interactive
visualizations of all Project Gutenberg books at <a href=http://hedonometer.org/books/v3/1/>http://hedonometer.org/books/v3/1/</a> and a selection of classic and popular
books at <a href=http://hedonometer.org/books/v1/>http://hedonometer.org/books/v1/</a>.</p><p>C. Principal Component Analysis (SVD)</p><p>between clusters of books [26]. We use the mean-centered
books and the distance function</p><p>We use the standard linear algebra technique Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to ﬁnd a decomposition of
stories onto an orthogonal basis of emotional arcs. Start-
ing with the sentiment time series for each book bi as row
i in the matrix A, we apply the SVD to ﬁnd</p><p>A = U ΣV T = W V T ,</p><p>(1)</p><p>where U contains the projection of each sentiment time
series onto each of the right singular vectors (rows of V T ,
eigenvectors of AT A), which have singular values given
along the diagonal of Σ, with W = U Σ. Diﬀerent intu-
itive interpretations of the matrices U, Σ, and V T are use-
ful in the various domains in which the SVD is applied;
here, we focus on right singular vectors as an orthonor-
mal basis for the sentiment time series in the rows of
A, which we will refer to as the modes. We combine
Σ and U into the single coeﬃcient matrix W for clarity
and convenience, such that W now represents the mode
coeﬃcients.</p><p>D. Hierarchical Clustering</p><p>D(bi, bj) = l−1</p><p>l

pervised machine learning method (a type of neural net-
work) to cluster emotional arcs [27]. The SOM works by
ﬁnding the most similar emotional arc in a random collec-
tion of arcs. We use an 8x8 SOM (for 64 nodes, roughly
5% of the number of books), connected on a square grid,
training according to the original procedure (with winner
take all, and scaling functions across both distance and
magnitude). We take the neighborhood inﬂuence func-
tion at iteration i as</p><p>Nbdk(i) =</p><p>(cid:104)

tering of stories, which proceeds by minimizing variance</p><p>for a node k in the set of nodes
, with distance func-
tion D given above and total number of nodes N . For</p><p>N</p><p>results shown here we take α =
0.15. We implement
the learning adaptation function at training iteration i as
f (i) = (i + 1)β, again with β =
0.15, a standard value
−
for the training hyper-parameters.</p><p>−</p><p>III. RESULTS</p><p>We obtain a collection of 1,327 books that are most-
ly, but not all, ﬁctional stories by using metadata from
Project Gutenberg to construct a rough ﬁlter. We ﬁnd
broad support for the following six emotional arcs:</p><p>“Rags to riches” (rise).</p><p>“Tragedy”, or “Riches to rags” (fall).</p><p>“Man in a hole” (fall-rise).</p><p>“Icarus” (rise-fall).</p><p>“Cinderella” (rise-fall-rise).</p><p>“Oedipus” (fall-rise-fall).</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>Importantly, we obtain these same six emotional arcs
from all possible arcs by observing them as the result
of three methods: As modes from a matrix decompo-
sition by SVD, as clusters in a hierarchical clustering
using Ward’s algorithm, and as clusters using unsuper-
vised machine learning. We examine each of the results
in this section.</p><p>A. Principal Component Analysis (SVD)</p><p>In Fig. 3 we show the leading 12 modes in both the
weighted (dark) and un-weighted (lighter) representa-
tion. In total, the ﬁrst 12 modes explain 80% and 94%
of the variance from the mean centered and raw time
series, respectively. The modes are from mean-centered
emotional arcs, such that the ﬁrst SVD mode need not
extract the average from the labMT scores nor the pos-
itivity bias present in language [28]. The coeﬃcients
for each mode within a single emotional arc are both
positive and negative, so we need to consider both the
modes and their negation. We can immediately recog-
nize the familiar shapes of core emotional arcs in the
ﬁrst four modes, and compositions of these emotional
arcs in modes 5 and 6. We observe “Rags to riches”
(mode 1, positive), “Tragedy” or “Riches to rags” (mode
1, negative), Vonnegut’s “Man in a hole” (mode 2, posi-
tive), “Icarus” (mode 2, negative), “Cinderella” (mode 3,
positive), “Oedipus” (mode 3, negative). We choose to
include modes 7–12 only for completeness, as these high
frequency modes have little contribution to variance and
do not align with core emotional arc archetypes from oth-
er methods (more below).</p><p>We emphasize that by deﬁnition of the SVD, the mode
coeﬃcients in W can be either positive and negative, such</p><p>4</p><p>that the modes themselves explain variance with both the
positive and negative version. In the right panels of each
mode in Fig. 3 we project the 1,327 stories onto each of
ﬁrst six modes and show the resulting coeﬃcients. While
none are far from 0 (as would be expected), mode 1 has
a mean slightly above 0 and both modes 3 and 4 have
means slightly below 0. To sort the books by their coeﬃ-
cient for each mode, we normalize the coeﬃcients within
each book in the rows of W to sum to 1, accounting for
books with higher total energy, and these are the coeﬃ-
cients shown in the right panels of each mode in Fig. 3.
In Appendix E, we provide supporting, intuitive details
of the SVD method, as well as example emotional arc
reconstruction using the modes (see Figs. S5–S7). As
expected, less than 10 modes are enough to reconstruct
the emotional arc to a degree of accuracy visible to the
eye.</p><p>We show labeled examples of the emotional arcs closest
to the top 6 modes in Figs. 4 and S8. We present both
the positive and negative modes, and the stories closest
to each by sorting on the coeﬃcient for that mode. For
the positive stories, we sort in ascending order, and vice
versa. Mode 1, which encompasses both the “Rags to
riches” and “Tragedy” emotional arcs, captures 30% of
the variance of the entire space. We examine the clos-
est stories to both sides of modes 1–3, and direct the
reader to Fig. S8 for more details on the higher order
modes. The two stories that have the most support from
the “Rags to riches” mode are The Winter’s Tale (1539)
and Oscar Wilde, Art and Morality: A Defence of “The
Picture of Dorian Gray” (33689). Among the most cate-
gorical tragedies we ﬁnd Lady Susan (946) and Warlord
of Kor (17958). Number 8 in the sorted list of tragedies
is perhaps the most famous tragedy: Romeo and Juli-
et by William Shakespeare. Mode 2 is the “Man in a
hole” emotional arc, and we ﬁnd the stories which most
closely follow this path to be The Magic of Oz (419) and
Children of the Frost (10736). The negation of mode 2
most closely resembles the emotional arc of the “Icarus”
narrative. For this emotional arc, the most characteris-
tic stories are Shadowings (34215) and Battle-Pieces and
Aspects of the War (12384). Mode 3 is the “Cinderella”
emotional arc, and includes Mystery of the Hasty Arrow
(17763) and Through the Magic Dorr (5317). The nega-
tion of Mode 3, which we refer to as “Oedipus”, is found
most characteristically in This World is Taboo (18172),
Old Indian Days (339), and The Evil Guest (10377). We
also note that the spread of the stories from their core
mode increases strongly for the higher modes.</p><p>B. Hierarchical Clustering</p><p>We show a dendrogram of the 60 clusters with highest
linkage cost in Fig. 5. The average silhouette coeﬃcient
is shown on the bottom of Fig. 5, and the distributions
of silhouette values within each cluster (see Figs. S17–
S18) can be used to analyze the appropriate number of</p><p>5</p><p>FIG. 3: Top 12 modes from the Singular Value Decomposition of 1,327 Project Gutenberg books. We show in a lighter color
modes weighted by their corresponding singular value, where we have scaled the matrix Σ such that the ﬁrst entry is 1 for
comparison (for reference, the largest singular value is 34.5). The mode coeﬃcients normalized for each book are shown in the
right panel accompanying each mode, in the range -1 to 1, with the “Tukey” box plot.</p><p>clusters [29]. A characteristic book from each cluster is
shown on the leaf nodes by sorting the books within each
cluster by the total distance to other books in the cluster
(e.g., considering each intra-cluster collection as a fully
connected weighted network, we take the most central
node), and in parenthesis the number of books in that
cluster. In other words, we label each cluster by consid-
ering the network centrality of the fully connected cluster
with edges weighted by the distance between stories. By
cutting the dendrogram in Fig. 5 at various linkage costs
we are able to extract clusters of the desired granularity.
For the cuts labeled C2, C4, and C8, we show these clus-
ters in Figs. S9, S11, and S15. We ﬁnd the ﬁrst four of our</p><p>ﬁnal six arcs appearing among the eight most diﬀerent
clusters (Fig. S15).</p><p>The clustering method groups stories with a “Man in a
hole” emotional arc for a range of diﬀerent variances, sep-
arate from the other arcs, in total these clusters (Panel
A, E, and I of Fig. S16) account for 30% of the Guten-
berg corpus. The remainder of the stories have emotional
arcs that are clustered among the “Tragedy” arc (32%),
“Rags to riches” arc (5%), and the “Oedipus” arc (31%).
A more detailed analysis of the results from hierarchical
clustering can be found in Appendix F, and this result
generally agrees with other attempts that use only hier-
archical clustering [12].</p><p>−0.10.00.1Mode1Mode2Mode3-0.500.5−0.10.00.1Mode4Mode5Mode6-0.500.5−0.10.00.1Mode7Mode8Mode9-0.500.5020406080100−0.10.00.1Mode10020406080100Mode11020406080100Mode12-0.500.5PercentageofbookRightsingularvectors(modes)ModecoeﬃcientsfromW 6</p><p>FIG. 4: First 3 SVD modes and their negation with the closest stories to each. To locate the emotional arcs on the same scale

W for the particular mode. The closest stories shown for each mode are those stories with emotional arcs which have the greatest
coeﬃcient in W . In parentheses for each story is the Project Gutenberg ID and the number of downloads from the Project
Gutenberg website, respectively. Links below each story point to an interactive visualization on <a href=http://hedonometer.org>http://hedonometer.org</a>
which enables detailed exploration of the emotional arc for the story.</p><p>C. Self Organizing Map (SOM)</p><p>Finally, we apply Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map
(SOM) and ﬁnd core arcs from unsupervised machine
learning on the emotional arcs. On the two dimensional
component plane, the prescribed network topology, we
ﬁnd seven spatially coherent groups, with ﬁve emotional
arcs. These spatial groups are comprised of stories with
core emotional arcs of diﬀering variance.</p><p>In Fig. 6 we see both the B-Matrix to demonstrate the
strength of spatial clustering and a heat-map showing
where we ﬁnd the winning nodes. The A–I labels refer to
the individual nodes shown in Fig. S19, and we observe
seven spatial groups in the both panels of Fig. 6: (1) A</p><p>and G, (2) B and I, (3) C, (4) D, (5) E, and (6) H, and (7)
F. These spatial clusters reinforce the visible similarity
of the winning node arcs, given that nodes H and F are
close spatially but separated by the B-Matrix and contain
very distinct arcs. We show the winning node emotional
arcs and the arcs of books for which they are the winners
in Fig. S19. The legend shows the node ID, numbers the
cluster by size, and in parentheses indicates the size of the
cluster on that individual node. In Panels A and G we see
varying strengths of the “Man in a hole” emotional arc.
In Panels B and I, the second largest individual cluster
consists of the “Rags to riches” arcs.
In Panel C, and
in Panel F, we ﬁnd the “Oedipus” emotional arc, with a
more pronounced positive start and decline in Panel C.

relation to their most suitable comparison: the book with
randomly shuﬄed words (“word salad”) and the resulting
text from a 2-gram Markov model trained on the indi-
vidual book itself (“nonsense”). We chose to compare to
“word salad” and “nonsense” versions as they are more
representative of a null model: written stories that are
without coherent plot or structure to generate a coherent
emotional arc, which is not true of a stochastic process
(e.g., a random walk model or noise). Examples of the
emotional arc and null emotional arcs for a single book</p><p>(37) The Shadow Line: A Confession(48) Lady Windermere&rsquo;s Fan(16) The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark(18) Operation: Outer Space(36) Hamlet, Prince of Denmark(47) The New Pun Book(31) Headlong Hall(36) The Girl Next Door(19) All for Love; Or, The World Well Lost: A Tragedy(38) Tom Swift and the Electronic Hydrolung(31) Nonsense Novels(26) Rinkitink in Oz(cid:13): Wherein Is Recorded the Perilo&mldr;(30) The Chimes(cid:13): A Goblin Story of Some Bells That R&mldr;(28) The Trees of Pride(37) Small Means and Great Ends(72) Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland: Illustrated by&mldr;(47) Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost(37) A Man of Means(44) Our American Cousin(24) All&rsquo;s Well That Ends Well(35) The Black Dwarf(20) To Him That Hath: A Tale of the West of Today(6) Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus(12) The Barrier(20) An Essay Upon Projects(26) The Time Machine(12) The Brand of Silence: A Detective Story(10) Manalive(11) The Man Who Knew(13) The Elusive Pimpernel(1) A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man(3) Paradise Lost(4) Little Fuzzy(4) The Marrow of Tradition(7) The Ultimate Weapon(12) The Napoleon of Notting Hill(9) The Cosmic Computer(8) In the Days of the Comet(5) Eastern Standard Tribe(4) When the Sleeper Wakes(6) The Triumphs of Eugne Valmont(26) The Winter&rsquo;s Tale(14) Tolstoy on Shakespeare: A Critical Essay on Sha&mldr;(34) Oliver Twist, Vol. 2 (of 3)(9) The Keepers of the King&rsquo;s Peace(25) The Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow(32) The Wrong Box(26) Deadwood Dick, the Prince of the Road; or, The &mldr;(26) Book of Wise Sayings: Selected Largely from East&mldr;(18) India&rsquo;s Love Lyrics(10) A Little Princess(cid:13): Being the whole story of Sar&mldr;(46) Through the Magic Door(13) The Celtic Twilight(17) Nonsenseorship(15) England, My England(23) The Haunted Room: A Tale(13) Rewards and Fairies(12) The Mirror of the Sea(19) Peter and Wendy(19) Pagan Passions(Cluster size) Example Book from clusterC2 = 5121C4 = 3495C8 = 2066Cluster 2619 (85)Cluster 2602 (54)Cluster 2621 (70)Cluster 2635 (155)Cluster 2612 (67)Cluster 2623 (114)Cluster 2594 (57)Cluster 2608 (57)Cluster 2633 (114)Cluster 2636 (228)Cluster 2616 (65)Cluster 2626 (95)Cluster 2613 (119)Cluster 2603 (81)Cluster 2617 (59)Cluster 2629 (140)Cluster 2642 (259)Cluster 2645 (354)Cluster 2647 (582)Cluster 2650 (737)Cluster 2598 (18)Cluster 2625 (38)Cluster 2595 (24)Cluster 2601 (34)Cluster 2624 (46)Cluster 2634 (72)Cluster 2638 (92)Cluster 2640 (130)Cluster 2604 (4)Cluster 2605 (8)Cluster 2610 (19)Cluster 2631 (27)Cluster 2641 (31)Cluster 2648 (161)Cluster 2609 (17)Cluster 2599 (10)Cluster 2615 (15)Cluster 2627 (32)Cluster 2628 (40)Cluster 2637 (72)Cluster 2600 (34)Cluster 2630 (68)Cluster 2597 (28)Cluster 2607 (54)Cluster 2620 (80)Cluster 2632 (112)Cluster 2643 (180)Cluster 2596 (30)Cluster 2618 (76)Cluster 2611 (38)Cluster 2606 (25)Cluster 2614 (38)Cluster 2622 (63)Cluster 2639 (101)Cluster 2644 (177)Cluster 2646 (357)Cluster 2649 (429)Cluster 2651 (590)Cluster 2652 (1327)01000200030004000500060007000Linkage Threshold C0.00.10.20.30.4Silhoutte coefficient 8</p><p>FIG. 6: Results of the SOM applied to Project Gutenberg books.

sense” versions. Sampled text using each method is given
in Appendix C. We re-run each method on the English
ﬁction Gutenberg Corpus with the null versions of each
book and verify that the emotional arcs of real stories
are not simply an artifact. The singular value spectrum
from the SVD is ﬂatter, with higher-frequency modes
appearing more quickly, and in total representing 45% of
the total variance present in real stories (see Figs. S22
and S25). Hierarchical clustering generates less distinct
clusters with considerably lower linkage cost (ﬁnal linkage
cost 1400 vs 7000) for the emotional arcs from nonsense
books, and the winning node vectors on a self-organizing
map lack coherent structure (see Figs. S26 and S29 in
Appendix H).</p><p>E. The Success of Stories</p><p>To examine how the emotional trajectory impacts suc-
cess, in Fig. 7 we examine the downloads for all of the
books that are most similar to each SVD mode (for addi-
tional modes, see Fig. S3 in Appendix B). We ﬁnd that
the ﬁrst four modes, which contain the greatest total
number of books, are not the most popular. Along with
the negative of mode 2, both polarities of modes 3 and
4 have markedly higher median downloads, while we dis-
count the importance of the mean with the high variance.
The success of the stories underlying these emotional arcs
suggests that the emotional experience of readers strong-
ly aﬀects how stories are shared. We ﬁnd “Icarus” (-SV
2), “Oedipus” (-SV 3), and two sequential “Man in a
hole” arcs (SV 4), are the three most successful emotion-
al arcs. These results are inﬂuenced by individual books</p><p>within each mode which have high numbers of downloads,
and we refer the reader to the download-sorted tables for
each mode in Appendix E.</p><p>IV. CONCLUSION</p><p>Using three distinct methods, we have demonstrated
that there is strong support for six core emotional arcs.
Our methodology brings to bear a cross section of data
science tools with a knowledge of the potential issues
that each present. We have also shown that consider-
ation of the emotional arc for a given story is important
for the success of that story. Of course, downloads are
only a rough proxy for success, and this work may pro-
vide an outline for more detailed analysis of the factors
that impact meaningful measures of success, i.e., sales or
cultural inﬂuence.</p><p>Our approach could be applied in the opposite direc-
tion: namely by beginning with the emotional arc and
aiding in the generation of compelling stories [30]. Under-
standing the emotional arcs of stories may be useful to
aid in constructing arguments [31] and teaching common
sense to artiﬁcial intelligence systems [32].</p><p>Extensions of our analysis that use a more curated
selection of full-text ﬁction can answer more detailed
questions about which stories are the most popular
throughout time, and across regions [10]. Automat-
ic extraction of character networks would allow a more
detailed analysis of plot structure for the Project Guten-
berg corpus used here [11, 33, 34]. Bridging the gap
between the full text stories [35] and systems that ana-
lyze plot sequences will allow such systems to undertake
studies of this scale [36]. Place could also be used to con-</p><p>01234567Ni01234567NjABCDEFGHI024681012141601234567Ni01234567NjABCDEFGHI0153045607590105 9</p><p>FIG. 7: Download statistics for stories whose SVD Modes comprise more than 2.5% of books, for N the total number of books

James</p><p>Knapp Reeve, Ohio, 1921.</p><p>Appendix A: Plot theories</p><p>S1</p><p>We again emphasize that our method of mining emotional arcs from novels does not measure the popular notion
of “plot”. To make the distinction even clearer, using terms often employed in narratology we consider the common
notion of “plot” to be fabula whereas the emotional arc is an attempt to measure the emotional trajectory of the
syuzhet, what could be commonly referred to as the “structure” [38]. For example, the diﬀerence between Booker’s
Overcoming the monster and Rags to riches may very well have a similar emotional arc, while being distinct plots.
Nevertheless, we include our research on the diﬀerent types of plots that have been enumerated.</p><p>There have been various hand-coded attempts to enumerate and classify the core types of stories from their plots,
including models that generalize broad categories and detailed classiﬁcation systems. We consider a range of these
theories in turn while noting that plot similarities do not necessitate a concordance of emotional arcs.</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>Three plots: In his 1959 book, Foster-Harris contends that there are three basic patterns of plot (extending from
the one central pattern of conﬂict): the happy ending, the unhappy ending, and the tragedy [39]. In these three
versions, the outcome of the story hinges on the nature and fortune of a central character: virtuous, selﬁsh, or
struck by fate, respectively.</p><p>Seven plots: Often espoused as early as elementary school in the United States, we have the notion that plots
revolve around the conﬂict of an individual with either (1) him or herself, (2) nature, (3) another individual,
(4) the environment, (5) technology, (6) the supernatural, or (7) a higher power [40].</p><p>Seven plots: Representing over three decades of work, Christopher Booker’s The Seven Basic Plots: Why we
tell stories describes in great detail seven narrative structures: [24]</p><p>•</p><p>– Overcoming the monster (e.g., Beowulf ).
– Rags to riches (e.g., Cinderella).
– The quest (e.g., King Solomons Mines).
– Voyage and return (e.g., The Time Machine).
– Comedy (e.g., A Midsummer Night’s Dream).
– Tragedy (e.g., Anna Karenina).
– Rebirth (e.g., Beauty and the Beast).</p><p>•</p><p>•</p><p>In addition to these seven, Booker contends that the unhappy ending of all but the tragedy are also possible.</p><p>Twenty plots: In 20 Master Plots, Ronald Tobias proposes plots that include “quest”, “underdog”, “metamor-
phosis”, “ascension”, and “descension” [41].</p><p>Thirty-six plots: In a translation by Lucille Ray, Georges Polti attempts to reconstruct the 36 plots that he
posits Gozzi originally enumerated [42]. These are quite speciﬁc and include “rivalry of kinsmen”, “all sacriﬁced
for passion”, both involuntary and voluntary “crimes of love” (with many more on this theme), “pursuit”, and

meaningfully reﬂect the narrative sentiment. In general, we proceed as described in Fig. 1 and consider a method of
breaking up the text as having three (interdependent) parameter choices for a sliding window:</p><ol><li><p>Length of the desired sample text.</p></li><li><p>Breakpoint between samples.</p></li><li><p>Overlap of each sample.</p></li></ol><p>These methods vary between rating individual words with no overlap to rating the entire text. To make our choice,
we consider competing two objectives of time series generation: meaningfulness of sentiment scores and increased
temporal resolution of time series. For the most accurate sentiment scores, we can use the entire book. The highest
temporal resolution is possible with a sliding window of length 1, generating time series that have potentially as many
data points as words in the book.</p><p>Since our goal is not only the generation of time series, but the comparison of time series across texts, we consider
the additional objective of consistency. We seek time series which are consistent both in the accuracy of the time
series, as well as consistent in the length of the resulting time series. Again these goals are orthogonal, and we note
that our choice here can be tuned to test the sensitivity.</p><p>We normalize the length of emotional arcs for books of diﬀerent length (while using a ﬁxed window size) by varying
the amount that the window needs to move. To make a time series of length l from a book with N words, we ﬁx the
sample length at k and set the overlap of samples to</p><p>(N</p><p>k</p><p>−</p><p>−</p><p>1)/l</p><p>words. This guarantees that we have temporal resolution l and sample length k for any N > k + l. We do not consider
books with N</p><p>k + l words.</p><p>To generate a sentiment score as in Fig. 1, we use a dictionary based approach for transparency and understanding
of sentiment. We select the LabMT dictionary for robust performance over many corpora and best coverage of word
usage. In particular, we determine a sample T ’s average happiness using the equation:</p><p>≤</p><p>havg(T ) =</p><p>(cid:80)N</p><p>i=1 havg(wi)
(cid:80)N</p><p>·
i=1 fi(T )</p><p>fi(T )</p><p>=</p><p>N
(cid:88)</p><p>i=1</p><p>havg(wi)</p><p>pi(T ),</p><p>·</p><p>(C1)</p><p>where we denote each of the N words in a given dictionary as wi, word sentiment scores as havg(wi), word frequency
as fi(T ), and normalized frequency of wi in T as pi(T ) = fi(T )/ (cid:80)N</p><p>i=1 fi(T ).</p><p>We note here that, in general, for each emotional arc we subtract the mean before computing the distance or</p><p>clustering.</p><ol><li>Null emotional arc construction</li></ol><p>In our ﬁrst analysis, we generated the null set of emotional arc time series by randomly shuﬄing the words in each
book. Other variations on generating this null set include sampling from a phrase-level parse of the book with a
Markov process, using continuous space random walks directly, or shuﬄing on sentences. Even more sophisticated
approaches could utilize Recursive Neural Nets (RNNs), for examples see <a href=http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/>http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/</a>
21/rnn-effectiveness/. For a realistic comparison to meaningful stories, we generate “nonsense” using a Markov
chain model (MCM) trained on 2-grams from each book. To contrast these approaches, consider the beginning of one
null version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland using randomly shuﬄed words (the “word salad”):</p><p>the but little –but all the , with I ﬂowers that small a what the he could queer ran it near , and altogether

the Caterpillar. I ’d better ask HER about it. The Queen ’s absence , and yet it was n’t very civil of you
, sooner or later. While she was considering in her life , and that ’s a fact. Alice kept her waiting. I

her very much at ﬁrst but she stopped hastily , for the rest were quite silent for a baby altogether Alice did

Alice , who had been to her in such a nice little dog near our house I should say With what porpoise. You

Hatter , and , after all it might happen any minute , while the Mock Turtle nine the next witness was the
Cat again , to be seen–everything seemed to be sure but I shall be a very long silence after this , as it ’s
coming down. In THAT direction , the Duchess said to Alice a good deal on where you want to go. Wow
wow wow. She ’ll get me executed , as the Dormouse go on with the bread and-butter. So they could n’t
guess of what work it would be like , said the King sharply Do you take me for his housemaid , she pictured
to herself , after all. Yes , but it was quite silent for a rabbit. She waited for a minute , nurse. Begin at
the house before she had tired herself out with trying , the Queen put on your shoes and stockings for you
said the Dodo. How CAN I have n’t opened it yet , before Alice could see it trot away quietly into the roof
of the Mock Turtle , suddenly dropping his voice , What HAVE you been doing here. It was high time to

the other , saying to herself , whenever I eat or drink anything so I should think you ’d like it , said the
Caterpillar. Ugh said the King.</p><ol start=2><li>Further Gutenberg Processing</li></ol><p>Here we provide the details of the processing applied to the Gutenberg corpus. In the manuscript, we stated the</p><p>following:</p><p>We start by selecting for only English books, with total words between 20,000 and 100,000, with more
than 20 downloads from the Project Gutenberg website, and with Library of Congress Class PN, PR,

“collection”). From within this set of books, we remove the front and backmatter of each book using
regular expression pattern matches.</p><p>The full list of keywords which we used to ﬁlter the titles are the following: “stories”, “collection”, “poems”, “com-
plete”, “essays”, “fables”, “tales”, “papers”, “poetry”, “verses”, “ballads”, “sketches”, “vol.”, “vols.”, “works”, “vol-

S5: Schematic of the Singular Value Decomposition applied to emotional arcs of Project Gutenberg books. Shown in A
are 10 randomly chosen emotional arcs, in U a “spy” of the matrix, in Σ the decreasing singular values, and in V T sinusoidal
modes. We emphasize that this representation is purely for intuition, as only U is a image of the actual matrix, and A has only
10 of the 1,327 books.</p><p>Further, we considered in Eq. 1 the mode coeﬃcient in the matrix W , and in Fig S6 we plot the second line of the</p><p>equation with W :</p><p>FIG. S6: Schematic of the Singular Value Decomposition applied to emotional arcs of Project Gutenberg books, with W = U Σ
containing the mode coeﬃcients. Again shown in A are 10 randomly chosen emotional arcs, in W a “spy” of the matrix used
in the analysis, and in V T representative sinusoidal modes.</p><p>With A written as W</p><p>reconstruct the emotional arc of book i, using mode j from V T , we simply multiply W [i, j]

modes from the SVD more closely reconstructs the detailed emotional arc. This book is well represented by the ﬁrst mode
alone, with only minor corrections from modes 2-11, as we should expect for a book whose emotional arc so closely resembles
the “Rags to Riches” arc.</p><p>−0.15−0.10−0.050.000.050.100.15ModespacehavgA1ModeApprox.B2ModeApprox.C3ModeApprox.−0.15−0.10−0.050.000.050.100.15ModespacehavgD4ModeApprox.E5ModeApprox.F6ModeApprox.−0.15−0.10−0.050.000.050.100.15ModespacehavgG7ModeApprox.H8ModeApprox.I9ModeApprox.020406080100Percentageofbook−0.15−0.10−0.050.000.050.100.15ModespacehavgJ10ModeApprox.020406080100PercentageofbookK11ModeApprox.020406080100PercentageofbookL12ModeApprox. 1.

in W for the particular mode. Shown in parenthesis for each story is the Project Gutenberg ID and the number of downloads
from the Project Gutenberg website, respectively. Links below each story point to an interactive visualization on http:
//hedonometer.org which enables detailed exploration of the emotional arc for the story.</p><p>Next, we provide a full list of the books closest to each mode in the analysis, both sorted by downloads and support
from the mode. Note: we are unable to provide a ﬁgure accompanying each arc in the following table

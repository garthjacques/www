Conclusion: Transitions and Prospects</p><p>INTRODUCTION:
TECHNOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
AS APOCALYPSE AND UTOPIA</p><p>Two specters are haunting Earth in the twenty-first century: the specters of
ecological catastrophe and automation.</p><p>In 2013, a US government observatory recorded</p><p>that global
concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide had reached 400 parts per
million for the first time in recorded history.1 This threshold, which the
Earth had not passed in as many as 3 million years, heralds accelerating
climate change over the coming century. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change predicts diminishing sea ice, acidification of the oceans,
and increasing frequency of droughts and extreme storm events.2</p><p>At the same time, news of technological breakthroughs in the context
of high unemployment and stagnant wages has produced anxious warnings
about the effects of automation on the future of work. In early 2014,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee published The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and
Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies.3 They surveyed a future in
which computer and robotics technology replaces human labor not just in
traditional domains such as agriculture and manufacturing, but also in
sectors ranging from medicine and law to transportation. At Oxford
University, a research unit released a widely publicized report estimating</p><p>that nearly half the jobs in the United States today are vulnerable to
computerization.4</p><p>These twin anxieties are in many ways diametrical opposites. The fear
of climate change is a fear of having too little: it anticipates a scarcity of
natural resources, the loss of agricultural land and habitable environments
—and ultimately the demise of an Earth that can support human life. The
fear of automation is, perversely, a fear of too much: a fully robotized
economy that produces so much, with so little human labor, that there is
no longer any need for workers. Can we really be facing a crisis of scarcity
and a crisis of abundance at the same time?</p><p>The argument of this book is that we are in fact facing such a
contradictory dual crisis. And it is the interaction of these two dynamics
that makes our historical moment so volatile and uncertain, full of both
promise and danger. In the chapters that follow, I will attempt to sketch
some of the possible interactions between these two dynamics.</p><p>First, however, I need to lay out the contours of current debates over</p><p>automation and climate change.</p><p>Rise of the Robots</p><p>“Welcome Robot Overlords,” reads a feature headline published in 2013
by Mother Jones magazine, “Please Don’t Fire Us?”5 The article, by
liberal pundit Kevin Drum, exemplifies a raft of coverage in recent years,
surveying the rapid spread of automation and computerization throughout
every part of the economy. These stories tend to veer between wonder and
dread at the possibilities of all this new gadgetry. In stories like Drum’s,
rapid progress in automation heralds the possibility of a world with a
better quality of life and more leisure time for all; but alternatively, it
heralds mass unemployment and the continued enrichment of the 1
percent.</p><p>This is not a new tension by any means. The folk tale of John Henry
and the steam hammer, which originated in the nineteenth century,
describes a railroad worker who tries to race against a steel powered drill
and wins—only to drop dead from the effort. But several factors have
come together to accentuate worries about technology and its effect on
labor. The persistently weak post-recession labor market has produced a</p><p>loss. Automation and
generalized background anxiety about
computerization are beginning to reach into professional and creative
industries that long seemed immune, threatening the jobs of the very
journalists who cover these issues. And the pace of change at least seems,
to many, to be faster than ever.</p><p>job</p><p>The “second machine age” is a concept promoted by Brynjolfsson and
McAfee. In their book of the same name, they argue that just as the first
machine age—the Industrial Revolution—replaced human muscle with
machine power, computerization is allowing us to greatly magnify, or even
replace, “the ability to use our brains to understand and shape our
environments.”6 In that book and its predecessor, Race Against the
Machine, Brynjolfsson and McAfee argue that computers and robots are
rapidly permeating every part of the economy, displacing labor from high-
and low-skill functions alike. Central to their view is the processing of
much of the world into digital information, with everything from books
and music to street networks now available in a form that can be copied
and transmitted around the world instantly and nearly for free.</p><p>The applications that this kind of data enables are enormously varied,
especially in combination with advances in physical-world robotics and
sensing. In a widely cited study using a detailed analysis of different
occupations produced by the US Department of Labor, Oxford University
researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne speculated that 47
percent of current US employment is susceptible to computerization
thanks to current technological developments.7 Stuart Elliott at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development uses the same
source data but a different approach over a longer time frame and
suggested that the figure could be as high as 80 percent. These figures are
the result of both subjective classifying decisions and complex
quantitative methodology, so it would be a mistake to put too much faith
in any exact number. Nevertheless, it should be clear that the possibility of
rapid further automation in the near future is very real.</p><p>Brynjolfsson and McAfee are perhaps the best-known prophets of
rapid automation, but their work fits into an exploding genre. Software
entrepreneur Martin Ford, for example, explores similar terrain in his
2015 work Rise of the Robots.8 He relies on much of the same literature
and reaches many of the same conclusions about the pace of automation.</p><p>His conclusions are somewhat more radical—a guaranteed universal basic
income, which will be discussed later in this book, occupies a place of
prominence; much of the rival literature, by contrast, offers little more
than bromides about education.</p><p>That many people are writing about rapid and socially dislocating
automation doesn’t mean that it’s an imminent reality. As I noted above,
anxiety about labor-saving technology is actually a constant through the
whole history of capitalism. But we do see many indications that we now
have the possibility—although not necessarily the reality—of drastically
reducing the need for human labor. A few examples will demonstrate the
diverse areas in which human labor is being reduced or eliminated
entirely.</p><p>In 2011, IBM made headlines with its Watson supercomputer, which
successfully competed and won against human competitors on the game
show Jeopardy. Although this feat was a somewhat frivolous publicity
stunt, it also demonstrated Watson’s suitability for other, more valuable
tasks. The technology is already being tested to assist doctors in
processing the enormous volume of medical literature to better diagnose
patients, which in fact was the system’s original purpose. But it is also
being released as the “Watson Engagement Advisor,” which is intended for
customer service and technical support applications. By responding to
free-form natural language queries from users, this software could
potentially replace the call center workers (many in places like India) who
currently perform this work. The review of legal documents, an extremely
time-consuming process traditionally performed by legions of junior
lawyers, is another promising application of the technology.</p><p>Another area of rapid advance is robotics, the interaction of machinery
with the physical world. Over the twentieth century, great advances were
made in the development of large-scale industrial robots, of the sort that
could operate a car assembly line. But only recently have they begun to
challenge the areas in which humans excel: fine-grained motor skills and
the navigation of a complex physical terrain. The US Department of
Defense is now developing computer-controlled sewing machines so as to
avoid sourcing its uniforms from China.9 Until just the past few years,
self-driving cars were regarded as well beyond the scope of our technical
ability. Now the combination of sensor technology and comprehensive
map databases is making it a reality in such projects as the Google self-</p><p>driving fleet. Meanwhile a company called Locus Robotics has launched a
robot that can process orders in giant warehouses, potentially replacing the
workers for Amazon and other companies who currently toil in often
brutal conditions.10</p><p>Automation continues to proceed even in agriculture, which once
consumed the largest share of human labor but now makes up a tiny
fraction of employment, especially in the United States and other rich
countries. In California, changing Mexican economic conditions and
border crackdowns have led to labor shortages. This has spurred farmers to
invest in new machinery that can take on even delicate tasks like fruit
harvesting, which have until now required the precision of a human
hand.11 This development illustrates a recurrent capitalist dynamic: as
workers become more powerful and better paid, the pressure on capitalists
to automate increases. When there is a huge pool of low wage migrant
farm labor, a $100,000 fruit picker looks like a wasteful indulgence. But
when workers are scarce and can command better wages, the incentive to
replace them with machinery is intensified.</p><p>The trend toward automation runs through the entire history of
capitalism. In recent years it was muted and somewhat disguised, because
of the enormous injection of cheap labor that global capitalism received
after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the turn toward capitalism in
China. But now even Chinese companies are facing labor shortages and
looking to new ways of automating and robotizing.</p><p>further</p><p>Innumerable</p><p>produced. Robot
anesthesiologists to replace physicians. A hamburger-making machine that
can replace the staff of a McDonald’s. Large-scale 3-D printers that can
turn out entire houses within a day. Each week brings strange new things.</p><p>examples</p><p>can</p><p>be</p><p>Automation is liable to move beyond even this, into the oldest and
most fundamental form of women’s labor. In the 1970s, the radical
feminist theorist Shulamith Firestone called for growing babies in
artificial wombs, as a way to liberate women from their dominated
position in the relations of reproduction.12 Fanciful at the time, such
technologies are becoming a reality today. Japanese scientists have
successfully birthed goats from artificial wombs and grown human
embryos for up to ten days. Further work on applying this technology to
human babies is now as much restricted by law as science; Japan prohibits</p><p>growing human embryos artificially for longer than fourteen days.13 Many
women find such a prospect off-putting and welcome the experience of
carrying a child. But surely many others would prefer to be liberated from
the obligation.</p><p>Most of this book will take for granted the premise of the automation
optimists, that within as little as a few decades we could live in a Star Trek
—like world where, as Kevin Drum put it in Mother Jones, “robots can do
everything humans can do, and they do it uncomplainingly, 24 hours a
day,” and “scarcity of ordinary consumer goods is a thing of the past.”14
Such claims are likely to be hyperbole, which for the purposes of this book
is fine: my approach is deliberately hyperbolic, sketching out simplified
ideal types to illustrate fundamental principles. It’s not important that
absolutely everything will be done by robots, only that a large amount of
the labor currently done by humans is in the process of being automated
away.</p><p>But there remains much controversy over just how fast automation can
proceed and what processes will be susceptible to it. So before delving
into the possible social consequences of that process, I will sketch out
some of the recent, rapid developments in the so-called “second machine
age” we live in. This is a sequel to—or, as some see it, merely an
extension of—the first machine age of large-scale industrial automation.</p><p>Fear of a Mechanical Planet</p><p>Objections to the predictions and fears of wide-ranging automation fall
into three broad categories. Some argue that reports of new technology are
overhyped and overblown and that we are a long way from truly being able
to replace human labor in most fields. Others, following a traditional
argument from mainstream economics, contend that past episodes of rapid
productivity growth have simply opened up new kinds of work and new
jobs, not led to massive unemployment, and that this time will be no
different. Finally, some on the Left see an obsessive focus on futuristic
automation scenarios as a distraction from more pressing political tasks
such as government investment and stimulus and improved wages and
conditions in the workplace.</p><p>REPORTS OF LABOR’S DEMISE: GREATLY EXAGGERATED?
Those who believe that technology is given exaggerated significance
usually point to the published statistics on productivity growth. A large-
scale adoption of robots and machinery ought to show up as a rapid
increase in the statistics that measure the productivity of labor—that is,
the amount of output that can be generated per worker. But in fact, the rate
of productivity growth in recent years has been relatively low. In the
United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that from 2007 to
2014, the annual rate of change was only 1.4 percent. That’s a pace lower
than at any time since the 1970s and half what was seen during the postwar
boom years.</p><p>This leads some to argue that the anecdotal accounts of great
breakthroughs in robotics and computation are misleading, because they
aren’t actually being translated into economic results. The economists
Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon are most closely associated with this
view.15 Doug Henwood, of the Left Business Observer, makes a similar
case from the Left.16</p><p>For more conservative economists like Cowen and Gordon, the
problem is largely technical. The new technologies aren’t really all that
great, at least from an economic perspective, compared to breakthroughs
like electricity or the internal combustion engine. We’ve picked the “low-
hanging fruit,” in Cowen’s terms, and unless we find some more we’re
doomed to slow growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Left critics, like Henwood and Dean Baker of the Center for Economic
and Policy Research, locate our problems not in technology, but in policy.
For them, blaming the weak economic recovery after the 2008 recession
on automation is a distraction from the real issue, which is that
government policy has not been sufficiently focused on fiscal stimulus and
job creation, thus preventing the economy from reaching full employment.
Worries about robots are, from this point of view, both counter-factual
(because productivity growth is low) and politically reactionary.</p><p>But others, including Brynjolfsson and McAfee, argue that even if no
great fundamental breakthroughs are on the horizon, there is much to be
gained from refining and recombining the breakthroughs we have already
seen. This is a common historical pattern; many new techniques that were
discovered during
for example, weren’t
economically fully exploited until the postwar boom. Moreover, even</p><p>the Great Depression,</p><p>those changes that don’t get reflected numerically in the Gross Domestic
Product can still contribute to our social wealth—like the huge volume of
information available freely and rapidly on the Internet, which has greatly
increased my efficiency in writing this book.</p><p>To leftist critics of the automation narrative, we can offer a more
complex answer: their analysis is narrowly correct but doesn’t look far
enough ahead. This is because the recent trends in productivity can also be
read as reflections of a curious tension between the economy’s short-term
equilibrium and its long-term potential.</p><p>The first two recessions of the twenty-first century led to weak
recoveries, characterized by stagnant wages and high unemployment. In
that context, the existence of a large pool of unemployed and low-wage
workers operates as a disincentive for employers to automate. After all,
why replace a worker with a robot, if the worker is cheaper? But a
corollary to this principle is that, if wages begin to rise and labor markets
tighten, employers will start to turn to the new technologies that are
currently being developed, rather than pay the cost of additional labor. As I
argue in the following sections, the real impediments to tight labor
markets are currently political, not technological.</p><p>AUTOMATION’S ETERNAL RETURN
Mainstream economists have for generations made the same argument
about the supposed danger that automation poses to labor. If some jobs are
automated, they argue, labor is freed up for other, new, and perhaps better
kinds of work. They point to agriculture, which once occupied most of the
workforce but now occupies only about 2 percent of it in a country like the
United States. The decline of agricultural employment freed up workers
who would go into the factories and make up the great industrial
manufacturing economy of the mid-twentieth century. And the subsequent
automation and offshoring of manufacturing, in turn, led to the boom in
the service sector.</p><p>Why, then, should today be any different? If a robot takes your job,
something else will surely be on the horizon. Supporters of this position
can point to previous waves of anxiety about automation, such as the one
in the 1990s that produced works like Jeremy Rifkin’s The End of Work
and Stanley Aronowitz and Bill DeFazio’s The Jobless Future.17 As early</p><p>as 1948, the mathematician and cyberneticist Norbert Weiner warned in
his book Cybernetics that in the “second, cybernetic industrial revolution,”
we were approaching a society in which “the average human being of
mediocre attainments or less has nothing to sell that it is worth anyone’s
money to buy.”18 While many jobs have indeed been lost to automation,
and jobless rates have risen and fallen with the business cycle, the social
crisis of extreme mass unemployment, which many of these authors
anticipated, has failed to arrive.</p><p>Of course, this is the kind of argument that can only be made from a
great academic height, while ignoring the pain and disruption caused to
actual workers who are displaced, whether or not they can eventually find
new work. And even some in the mainstream suspect that, perhaps, this
time really is different. Nobel Prize–winner and New York Times columnist
Paul Krugman is perhaps the most prominent person to give voice to these
doubts.19 But the deeper problem with the traditional analysis is that it
poses the process as a scientific inevitability when it is actually a social
and political choice.</p><p>Today, most labor struggles turn on increasing wages and benefits or
improving working conditions. But until the time of the Great Depression
in the 1930s, socialist and labor movements struggled for, and won,
progressive reductions in the length of the working day as well. In the
nineteenth century, the ten-hour-day movement gave way to the eight-
hour-day movement. Even in the 1930s, the American Federation of Labor
supported a law to reduce the work week to thirty hours. But after World
War II, for a variety of reasons, work reduction gradually disappeared
from labor’s agenda. The forty-hour (or more) week was taken for granted,
and the question became merely how well it would be compensated.</p><p>This would have surprised the economist John Maynard Keynes, who
speculated in the 1930s that people in our time would work as little as
fifteen hours per week. That would mean working less than a third of the
forty-hour work week that is still widely considered to be the standard.
And yet productivity since Keynes’s time has more than tripled, so it
would have been possible to take that growth in the form of free time for
the masses. This didn’t happen, not because it isn’t technically possible,
but because of the outcomes of the political choices and social struggles of
the twentieth century.</p><p>Some will argue that keeping our high working hours was worth it,
because it made possible all the trappings of our modern world that
Keynes could never have imagined, such as smartphones, flat-screen
televisions, and the Internet. Because when most people think about
working shorter hours, they think that they will have to give up some of
the trappings of our advanced capitalist society, things that they enjoy, like
their smartphones and their televisions.</p><p>That might be true to some extent, depending on the degree of work
reduction we’re talking about. But reducing work time can also reduce the
cost of living, because it gives us time to do things that we would
otherwise have to pay someone else to do, and it reduces costs like
commuting that we have to pay just in order to work. And beyond that, our
current society is filled with work that doesn’t add anything to human
flourishing and exists only to enrich someone else’s bottom line—things
like the collection of student loans (which would not exist if education
were free) and many big-bank positions that facilitate dangerous and
destabilizing speculation.</p><p>In any case, if we were to decide to make work reduction a social
priority, we could gradually reduce hours in line with increases in
productivity, so that people could gradually work less and less, while
enjoying the same standard of living. And while some might prefer to keep
working more in order to accumulate more and more stuff, probably many
others would not. Even if we can never reach the pure post-work utopia,
we can certainly move closer to it. Decreasing the work week from forty
hours to thirty would move us in that direction. So would something like a
universal basic income, which guarantees a minimum payment to every
citizen regardless of work or any of the other strings that are attached to
traditional welfare plans.</p><p>TECHNOPHILIA AS A TECHNOLOGY OF DISTRACTION
Even supposing that, in the long run, the political questions and
possibilities raised by automation are real, a good argument can be made
that we face more significant short-term challenges. As noted above,
productivity growth, which gives an indication of the number of workers
actually needed to run the economy, has in fact been quite weak in recent
years. Moreover, the lack of job growth after recent economic recessions</p><p>can plausibly be attributed not to robots, but to failures of government
policy.</p><p>That’s because in the short run, the lack of jobs can be attributed not to
automation, but to a lack of what is known, in the economists’ jargon, as
aggregate demand. In other words, the reason employers don’t hire more
workers is because there aren’t enough people buying their products, and
the reason people aren’t buying their products is because they don’t have
enough money—either because they don’t have jobs or because their
wages are too low.</p><p>The solution to this situation, according to traditional Keynesian
economic theories, is for the government to increase demand by a
combination of monetary policy (lowering interest rates), fiscal policy
(government investment in job creation, for instance through building
infrastructure), and regulation (such as a higher minimum wage). And
while governments did lower interest rates after the Great Recession, they
did not do so in combination with sufficient investment in job creation,
leading to a “jobless recovery” in which output—that is, the quantity of
to grow again, but
goods and services produced—slowly began
employment did not return to its prerecession levels.</p><p>I do not disagree that the traditional Keynesian remedies remain
important and necessary, as far as they go. And I share the worry that, in
some cases, the specter of the robot future is used by the political center
and right to distract attention from the short-term problems of the
unemployed, in order to make it seem as though mass unemployment and
underemployment are simply inevitable.</p><p>But I still think it’s worth talking about what a more highly automated
future could mean for all of us. That’s partly because, contrary to the
skeptics, I do think that the possibility for further labor-saving technology
is being rapidly developed, even if it isn’t yet finding its way into the
economy in a way that’s reflected in the productivity statistics. And it’s
also because even if the short-term obstacle of austerity economics and
insufficient government stimulus is overcome, we still face the political
question that we have faced ever since the industrial revolution: will new
technologies of production lead to greater free time for all, or will we
remain locked into a cycle in which productivity gains only benefit the
few, while the rest of us work longer than ever?</p><p>The Specter of Climate Crisis</p><p>Thus far, I’ve discussed only one of the challenges that I cited at the
outset, the threat posed by technology that displaces workers. But the
second, the ecological crisis, is at least as significant for the future of
capitalism and of the human race. The scientific consensus about climate
change is clear. Human carbon emissions are warming the atmosphere,
leading to hotter temperatures, extreme weather, and shortages of water
and other essential resources. Differences of opinion chiefly concern how
serious the effects will be, how disruptive they will be to human
civilization, and how (or whether) it will be possible to adjust to those
disruptions.</p><p>Many readers will no doubt be thinking that this does not exhaust the
limits of debate, for there are also those who deny the existence of human-
caused climate change entirely. These people certainly exist, and they are
backed by very deep-pocketed corporate interests and have prominent
advocates within major political parties. But it would be a mistake to take
these people as proponents of a serious scientific debate. The small fringe
of writers and scientists who promote denialist theories may or may not be
sincere in their claims to pursue truth, but their funders must be regarded
as cynics, whose actions promote a different agenda.</p><p>For as we will see in a later chapter, the key question surrounding
climate change is not whether climate change is occurring, but rather who
will survive the change. Even in the worst-case scenarios, scientists are
not arguing that the Earth will become totally uninhabitable. What will
happen—and is happening—is that struggles over space and resources will
intensify as habitats degrade. In this context—and particularly in concert
with the technological trends discussed above—it may be possible for a
small elite to continue to pollute the planet, protecting their own comfort
while condemning most of the world’s population to misery. It is that
agenda, not any serious engagement with climate science, that drives
corporate titans in the direction of denialism.</p><p>Not all capitalists are committed to denialism, however. Some who
acknowledge the magnitude of climate change nevertheless insist that that
we can trust the workings of the free market to deliver solutions. But while
this is not in fact totally absurd, it is highly misleading. For the</p><p>enlightened eco-capitalists turn out to not really be so different from the
troglodyte denialists.</p><p>Entrepreneurs, we are assured, will find new green technologies that
will move us away from fossil fuel dependence without government
intervention. But in many cases, these innovations involve high-tech green
solutions that are only accessible to the rich. At the same time, truly
global solutions are rejected, even when, as in the case of taxing carbon,
they are ostensibly “market” solutions. The initiatives that excite the eco-
capitalists are, instead, fanciful projects of “geoengineering” that attempt
to manipulate the climate, despite the uncertain efficacy and unknown side
effects of such procedures. As with the Koch brothers and their denialist
ilk, the eco-capitalists are concerned primarily with preserving the
prerogatives and lifestyles of the elite, even if they put a more
environmentalist veneer on this agenda. We will return to all of this in
Chapter 4.</p><p>I turn now to the specific purpose of this book.</p><p>Politics in Command</p><p>Why, the reader might ask, is it even necessary to write another book about
automation and the postwork future? The topic has become an entire
subgenre in recent years; Brynjolfsson and McAfee are just one example.
Others include Ford’s Rise of the Robots and articles from the Atlantic’s
Derek Thompson, Slate’s Farhad Manjoo, and Mother Jones’s Kevin
Drum.20 Each insists that technology is rapidly making work obsolete, but
they flail vainly at an answer to the problem of making sure that
technology leads to shared prosperity rather than increasing inequality. At
best, like Brynjolfsson and McAfee, they fall back on familiar liberal
bromides: entrepreneurship and education will allow us all to thrive even
if all of our current work is automated away.</p><p>The one thing missing from all these accounts, the thing I want to
inject into this debate, is politics, and specifically class struggle. As Mike
Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute has pointed out, these projections of a
postwork future tend toward a hazy technocratic utopianism, a “forward
projection of the Keynesian-Fordism of the past,” in which “prosperity
leads to redistribution leads to leisure and public goods.”21 Thus, while the</p><p>transition may be difficult in places, we should ultimately be content with
accelerating technological development and reassure ourselves that all
will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds.</p><p>This outlook ignores the central defining features of the society we
currently live in: capitalist class and property relations. Who benefits from
automation, and who loses, is ultimately a consequence not of the robots
themselves, but of who owns them. Hence it is impossible to understand
the unfolding of the ecological crisis and developments in automation
without understanding a third crisis through which both are mediated, the
crisis of the capitalist economy. For neither climate change nor automation
can be understood as problems (or solutions) in and of themselves. What
is so dangerous, rather, is the way they manifest themselves in an
economy dedicated to maximizing profits and growth, and in which money
and power are held in the hands of a tiny elite.</p><p>The growing inequality of wealth and income in the world has become
an increasing focus of attention from activists, politicians, and pundits.
Occupy Wall Street struck a chord with the slogan “we are the 99 percent,”
drawing attention to the fact that almost all the gains from economic
growth in recent decades have accrued to 1 percent or less of the
population. Economist Thomas Piketty scored an improbable best seller
with Capital in the Twenty-First Century, a massive treatise about the
history of wealth and the prospect of an increasingly unequal world.22</p><p>The two crises I’ve described are fundamentally about inequality as
well. They are about the distribution of scarcity and abundance, about who
will pay the costs of ecological damage and who will enjoy the benefits of
a highly productive, automated economy. There are ways to reckon with
the human impact on the Earth’s climate, and there are ways to ensure that
automation brings material prosperity for all rather than impoverishment
and desperation for most. But those possible futures will require a very
different kind of economic system than the one that became globally
dominant by the late twentieth century.</p><p>Four Futures</p><p>In his three-hour meditation on the representation of Los Angeles in
movies, Los Angeles Plays Itself, film scholar Thom Andersen suggests</p><p>that “if we can appreciate documentaries for their dramatic qualities,
perhaps we can appreciate
their documentary
fiction
revelations.”23 This book tries to incorporate that insight.</p><p>films</p><p>for</p><p>This is not quite a normal work of nonfiction, but it also is not fiction,
nor would I put myself in the genre of “futurism.” Rather, it is an attempt
to use the tools of social science in combination with those of speculative
fiction to explore the space of possibilities in which our future political
conflicts will play out. Call it a type of “social science fiction.”</p><p>One way of differentiating social science from science fiction is that
the first is about describing the world that is, while the second speculates
about a world that might be. But really, both are a mixture of imagination
and empirical investigation, put together in different ways. Both attempt
to understand empirical facts and lived experience as something that is
shaped by abstract—and not directly perceptible—structural forces.</p><p>Certain types of speculative fiction are more attuned than others to the
particularities of social structure and political economy. In Star Wars, you
don’t really care about the details of the galactic political economy. And
when the author tries to flesh them out, as George Lucas did in his widely
derided Star Wars prequel movies, it only gums up the story. In a world
like Star Trek, on the other hand, these details actually matter. Even though
Star Wars and Star Trek might superficially look like similar tales of space
travel and swashbuckling, they are fundamentally different types of
fiction. The former exists only for its characters and its mythic narrative,
while the latter wants to root its characters in a richly and logically
structured social world.</p><p>This is related to, but transcends, a distinction that is customarily
made among science fiction fans, between “hard” and “soft” science
fiction. The former is supposed to be more plausible by way of its
grounding in present-day science. But this distinction reflects the biases of
the genre’s traditional fan base and its fetishization of the natural sciences.
The more important distinction, as just mentioned, is between the stories
that take their world-building seriously, and those that don’t. What is
called soft science fiction is sometimes just Star Wars–style adventure
stories, but sometimes it makes much richer use of social science.
Meanwhile many of the supposedly “harder” counterparts pair detailed
exegeses of physics with naïve or utterly conventional understandings of
social relations and human behavior. Ken MacLeod’s Fall Revolution</p><p>novels, which tell a tale of political upheaval and space colonization, are
rooted in his understanding of Marxist political economy and his personal
background in the Scottish socialist movement of the 1970s. It is that
grounding, rather than any particular insight into the physics of space
travel or Martian terraforming, that gives the novels their “hardness.”</p><p>Speculative fiction as a tool of social analysis and critique goes back at
least as far as H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine—if not Mary Shelley’s
Frankenstein—but the field has grown particularly rich of late. In popular
culture, this can be seen even in the enormous success of dystopian young
adult fictions like The Hunger Games and Divergent. But while such
stories are fairly transparent allegories of the class society we already live
in, it is not hard to find others who have pushed the boundary further,
speculating about the long-term implications of present-day trends. The
interface between the actual and the potential manifests itself most
potently in the near-future fictions of those authors who place their stories
just a few steps ahead of the present, like William Gibson in his early
twenty-first-century series of novels (Pattern Recognition, Spook Country,
Zero History) or Cory Doctorow in Homeland (and the forthcoming
Walkaway). The significance of information technology, automation,
surveillance, ecological destruction—themes that will echo throughout
this book—recur in these novels.</p><p>The political implications of different imagined worlds have also
begun to come to the fore. Charles Stross is both an author of social
science fiction and a frequent blogger in a more social scientific mode. He
has particularly criticized the popular “steampunk” subgenre. He notes
that it presents a kind of idealized nineteenth century full of zeppelins and
steam-powered gadgetry but glosses over the key social relations of that
era: the Dickensian misery of the working class and the horrors of
colonialism. But Stross, and others like Ken MacLeod and China Miéville,
have used fictions about future, past, and alternative worlds to give a fuller
picture of class and social conflict.</p><p>Fictional futures are, in my view, preferable to those works of
“futurism” that attempt to directly predict the future, obscuring its
inherent uncertainty and contingency and thereby stultifying the reader.
Within the areas discussed in this book, a paradigmatic futurist would be
someone like Ray Kurzweil, who confidently predicts that by 2049,
computers will have achieved humanlike intelligence, with all manner of</p><p>world-changing consequences.24 Such prognostications generally end up
unconvincing as prophecy and unsatisfying as fiction. Science fiction is to
futurism what social theory is to conspiracy theory: an altogether richer,
more honest, and more humble enterprise. Or to put it another way, it is
always more interesting to read an account that derives the general from
the particular (social theory) or the particular from the general (science
fiction), rather than attempting to go from the general to the general
(futurism) or the particular to the particular (conspiracism).</p><p>Rosa Luxemburg, the great early twentieth-century socialist theorist and
organizer, popularized a slogan: “Bourgeois society stands at the
crossroads, either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.”25
That’s truer today than it has ever been. In this book, I will suggest not two
but four possible outcomes—two socialisms and two barbarisms, if you
will. The four chapters that follow can be thought of as what the
sociologist Max Weber called “ideal types”: simplified, pure models of
how society can be organized, designed to illuminate a few key issues that
confront us today and will confront us in the future—part social science,
part science fiction. Real life, of course, is always much more
complicated, but the point of an ideal type is to focus on specific issues,
setting others aside.</p><p>The aim is to develop an understanding of our present moment and
map the possible futures that lie ahead in stylized form. The basic
assumption is that the trend toward increasing automation will continue in
all domains of the economy. Moreover, I will not make the assumption
that was made by most economists in the twentieth century: that even as
some jobs are eliminated by mechanization, the market will automatically
generate more than enough new jobs to make up for the loss.</p><p>In the spirit of working in ideal types, I will make the strongest
assumption possible: all need for human labor in the production process
can be eliminated, and it is possible to live a life of pure leisure while
machines do all the work. In fact, this isn’t logically possible, if we’re
imagining a world where the machines serve us rather than controlling us
like those in the movie The Matrix. We will have to do at least a little
work to manage and maintain the machines.</p><p>But I assume all human labor away to avoid entangling myself in a
debate that has bedeviled the Left ever since the Industrial Revolution:</p><p>how a postcapitalist society would manage labor and production, in the
absence of capitalist bosses with control over the means of production.
This is an important (and ongoing) debate, but the issues I’m concerned
with will be clearer if I can set it aside. Thus, the constant in my equation
is that technical change tends toward perfect automation.</p><p>If automation is the constant, ecological crisis and class power are the
variables. The ecological question is, more or less, just how bad the effects
of climate change and resource depletion will end up being. In the best
case scenario, the shift to renewable energy will combine with new
methods of ameliorating and reversing climate change, and it will in fact
be possible to use all our robot technology to provide a high standard of
living for everyone. The spectrum, in other words, runs from scarcity to
abundance.</p><p>The question of class power comes down to how we end up tackling
the massive inequality of wealth, income, and political power in the world
today. To the extent that the rich are able to maintain their power, we will
live in a world where they enjoy the benefits of automated production,
while the rest of us pay the costs of ecological destruction—if we can
survive at all. To the extent that we can move toward a world of greater
equality, then the future will be characterized by some combination of
shared sacrifice and shared prosperity, depending on where we are on the
other, ecological dimension.</p><p>So the model posits that we can end up in a world of either scarcity or
abundance, alongside either hierarchy or equality. This makes for four
possible combinations, which can be set up as a two-by-two grid.</p><p>Equality</p><p>Hierarchy</p><p>Abundance</p><p>communism</p><p>rentism</p><p>Scarcity</p><p>socialism</p><p>exterminism</p><p>Exercises like this aren’t unprecedented. A similar typology can be found
in a 1999 article by Robert Costanza in The Futurist.26 There are four
scenarios: Star Trek, Big Government, Ecotopia, and Mad Max. For
Costanza, however, the two axes are “world view and policies” and “the
real state of the world.” Thus the four boxes are filled in according to
whether human ideological predilections match reality: in the “Big
Government” scenario, for example, progress is restrained by safety</p><p>standards because the “technological skeptics” deny the reality of
unlimited resources.</p><p>My contribution to this debate is to emphasize the significance of
capitalism and politics. Both the possibility of ecological limits and the
political constraints of a class society are, in this view, “material”
constraints. And the interaction between them is what will determine our
path forward.</p><p>The existence of capitalism as a system of class power, with a ruling
elite that will try to preserve itself into any possible future, is therefore a
central structuring theme of this book, a theme that I believe is absent
from almost every other attempt to understand the trajectory of a highly
automated postindustrial economy. Technological developments give a
context for social transformations, but they never determine them directly;
change is always mediated by the power struggles between organized
masses of people. The question is who wins and who loses, and not, as
technocratic authors like Costanza would have it, who has the “correct”
view of the objective nature of the world.</p><p>So for me, sketching out multiple futures is an attempt to leave a place
for the political and the contingent. My intention is not to claim that one
future will automatically appear through the magical working out of
technical and ecological factors that appear from outside. Instead, it is to
insist that where we end up will be a result of political struggle. The
intersection of science fiction and politics is these days often associated
with the libertarian right and its deterministic techno-utopian fantasies; I
hope to reclaim the long left-wing tradition of mixing imaginative
speculation with political economy.</p><p>The starting point of the entire analysis is that capitalism is going to
end, and that, as Luxemburg said, it is either “transition to socialism or
regression into barbarism.”27 So this thought experiment is an attempt to
make sense of the socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is
successful, and the barbarisms we may be consigned to if we fail.</p><p>This doesn’t mean engaging in the secular eschatology that sets a firm
end date on capitalism—too many socialists and apocalyptic preachers
have made that mistake. It’s too simplistic to think of discrete endings in
any case; labels for social systems like “capitalism” and “socialism” are
abstractions, and there is never a single moment when we can definitively</p><p>say that one turns into the other. My view is closer to the sociologist
Wolfgang Streeck:</p><p>The image I have of the end of capitalism—an end that I believe is already under way—is
one of a social system in chronic disrepair, for reasons of its own and regardless of the
absence of a viable alternative. While we cannot know when and how exactly capitalism
will disappear and what will succeed it, what matters is that no force is on hand that could
be expected to reverse the three downward trends in economic growth, social equality
and financial stability and end their mutual reinforcement.28</p><p>The four chapters that follow are each dedicated to one of the four futures:
communism, rentism, socialism, and exterminism. In addition
to
sketching out a plausible future, each of those four chapters emphasizes a
key theme that is relevant to the world we live in now, that would assume
special importance in that particular future.</p><p>The chapter on communism dwells on the way we construct meaning
when life is not centered around wage labor and what kind of hierarchies
and conflicts arise in a world no longer structured by the master narrative
of capitalism. The depiction of rentism is largely a reflection on
intellectual property and what happens when the private property form is
applied to more and more of the immaterial patterns and concepts that
guide our culture and economy. The story of socialism is a story about the
climate crisis and our need to adapt to it, but also about the way in which
some old leftist shibboleths about Nature and the Market impede us from
seeing how neither the fetishization of the natural world nor the hatred of
the market is necessarily sufficient, or even relevant, to the attempt to
construct an ecologically stable world beyond capitalism. Finally, the tale
of exterminism is the story of the militarization of the world, a
phenomenon that encompasses everything from endless war in the Middle
East to black teenagers being shot down by police on the streets of
American cities.</p><p>We are already moving rapidly away from industrial capitalism as we
understood it in the twentieth century, and there is little chance that we
will move back in that direction. We are moving away into an uncertain
future. I hope to provide a broad context for that future, but I do not want
to create any sense of certainty. I follow David Brin, who has both written
science fiction and gone by the “futurist” label, when he says that he is
“much more interested in exploring possibilities than likelihoods, because
a great many more things might happen than actually do.”29</p><p>The importance of assessing possibility rather than likelihood is that it
puts our collective action at the center, while making confident predictions
only encourages passivity. In the same essay, Brin cites George Orwell’s
1984 as a “self-preventing prophecy” that helped prevent the scenario it
described from coming true. In the wake of the War on Terror and former
National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden’s disclosures
about NSA surveillance, one can question just how self-preventing that
particular prophecy was, but the general point stands.</p><p>If this book contributes in some small way to making the oppressive
futures described self-preventing, and their egalitarian alternatives self-
fulfilling, then it will have served its purpose.</p><p>1
COMMUNISM: EQUALITY
AND ABUNDANCE</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut’s first novel, Player Piano, describes a society that seems,
on the surface, like a postlabor utopia, where machines have liberated
humans from toil. For Vonnegut, however, this isn’t a utopia at all. He
describes a future where production is almost entirely carried out by
machines, overseen by a small technocratic elite. Everyone else is
essentially superfluous from an economic perspective, but the society is
rich enough to provide a comfortable life for all of them.</p><p>Vonnegut refers to this condition as a “second childhood” at one point,
and he views it not as an achievement but as a horror. For him, and for the
main protagonists in the novel, the main danger of an automated society is
that it deprives life of all meaning and dignity. If most people are not
engaged directly in producing the necessities of life, he seems to think,
they will inevitably fall into torpor and despair.</p><p>There are certain ways in which the 1952 novel clearly dates itself. For
one thing, this was the era of high industrialism in both the capitalist and
communist worlds, based on the giant factory and the assembly line. And
to be sure, today’s economy is still reliant on this kind of massive scale
production, more so than many people realize. But Vonnegut doesn’t
consider the possibility that production can become less centralized—and
hence, less reliant on a managerial elite—without sliding back into less
efficient, labor-intensive forms of production. Technologies like 3-D
printing (and for that matter the personal computer) point in that direction.</p><p>And the notion that social meaning must come from “productive,”
waged work is deeply rooted in patriarchal notions of the male
breadwinner supporting a family. There is, throughout the book, a constant
conflation between work that is rewarded with social prestige—by being
regarded as a “job” and remunerated with a wage—and work that is
materially necessary in the sense that it reproduces society and secures the
conditions of life. The women in the book continue to perform the unpaid
caring and emotional labor that has always been expected of them, and
Vonnegut seems not to care whether this is important or a source of
meaning for them.</p><p>The protagonist of Player Piano is Paul Proteus, a well-regarded
factory manager who becomes a disillusioned critic of the system. Late in
the book, he helps draft a manifesto that calls for rolling back automation
on the grounds that “men, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy
unless engaged in enterprises that make them feel useful.”1 But throughout
the novel, Paul’s wife Anita has been engaged in something apparently
useful—namely, compensating for Paul’s social ineptitude, and propping
up his self-confidence. Reacting to Paul’s failure to correctly interpret the
social cues of a superior regarding a new job assignment, Anita argues that
women “have insight into things that men don’t have.”2 Perhaps if men
could learn such insights, they too might learn to provide forms of useful
labor that cannot yet be automated. But such skills are not factored into
the notion of productive labor that Vonnegut associates with full humanity,
or at least full manhood. This gives an indication of what is really going
on here, and it is what Vonnegut has already told us: men don’t want to
actually be useful, they merely want to “feel” useful. The problem of
automation turns out to be a crisis of male feelings.</p><p>Perhaps this is why so many of Vonnegut’s apprehensions about
automation remain intractable anxieties, afflicting both our economic
conversations and our popular culture. Even when we hate our jobs,
sometimes we still lean on them as sources of identity and social worth.
Many cannot imagine a world beyond work as anything but one of
dissipation and sloth. The 2008 animated movie WALL-E, for example,
portrays a world where all humans have departed a ruined Earth and live
lives of leisure in fully automated starships. But the sympathetic
protagonist of the movie is a sentient robot, left behind on Earth to pick up</p><p>trash—a worker, in other words. The humans, by contrast, are grotesque—
obese and torpid parodies of consumerism.</p><p>In order to imagine a totally postscarcity world as a utopia, then, it is
necessary to imagine the sources of meaning and purpose in a world where
we are not defined by our paid work. First, however, let us examine how
such a communist society fits into our axes of hierarchy vs. equality,
scarcity vs. abundance.</p><p>Kitchens of the Future</p><p>Although he was best known as the author of The Communist Manifesto,
Karl Marx was reluctant to say much about the content of a communist
society. Sometimes, he would speak of the transitional socialist period
where workers would take over and run the existing machinery of
production, but this was not what he envisioned as his ultimate political
objective. That objective was communism, something that transcended
labor and leisure, something that went far beyond the world of work as we
understand it. But to say too much about what a communist society might
ultimately look like, he thought, was a foolish exercise in writing recipes
“for the cook-shops of the future.”3 History was made by the movements
of the masses, he believed, not by armchair theorists.</p><p>There are moments, however, where Marx allows himself to speculate
in more general terms. In the third volume of Capital, he distinguishes
between a “realm of necessity” and a “realm of freedom.” In the realm of
necessity we must “wrestle with Nature to satisfy [our] wants, to maintain
and reproduce life” by means of physical labor in production.4 This realm
of necessity, Marx says, exists “in all social formations and under all
possible modes of production,” presumably including socialism.5 What
distinguishes socialism from capitalism, then, is that production is
rationally planned and democratically organized, rather than operating at
the whim of the capitalist or the market. For Marx, however, this level of
social development was only a precondition for “that development of
human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which,
however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its
basis.”6</p><p>The reason this brief passage is important is that it provides a wholly
different approach to postcapitalist politics than the one many of us have
been taught. Those of us who were introduced to Marx in a classroom were
likely told that he venerated labor and believed that it was only through
laboring that human beings truly defined and realized themselves. And in
some places he does say something like this, although this usually seems
to refer to the value of purposive self-activity in general, rather than the
more narrow phenomenon of doing something for someone else in return
for a paycheck.</p><p>But in the passage above, Marx is saying something different: work
has been, throughout human history, an unfortunate necessity. It’s
important to keep the lights on, and sometimes that takes work—but
keeping the lights on is not what makes us human. It is merely a necessity
that we can and must transcend if we are to be truly free. Freedom begins
where work ends—the realm of freedom is after hours, on the weekend, on
vacation, and not at work. And that remains true whether you work for a
capitalist boss or a worker-owned cooperative. The space of work is still
the realm of necessity and not of freedom.</p><p>Elsewhere, Marx even suggests that one day we may be able to free
ourselves from the realm of necessity altogether. In Critique of the Gotha
Program, he writes:</p><p>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the
individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and
physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life’s
prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around
development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more
abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its
entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each
according to his needs!7</p><p>Most of us are so accustomed to capitalist relations of production that it is
hard to even imagine individuals who are not subordinated to “the division
of labor.” We’re used to having bosses who devise plans and then instruct
us to carry them out; what Marx is suggesting is that it is possible to erase
the barriers between those who make plans for their own benefit and those
who carry them out—which would of course mean erasing the distinction
between those who manage the business and those who make it run.</p><p>But it also means something even more radical: erasing the distinction
between what counts as a business and what counts as a collective leisure
activity. Only in that situation might we find that “labor has become not
only a means of life but life’s prime want.” In that case, work wouldn’t be
work at all any more, it would be what we actually choose to do with our
free time. Then we could all obey the injunction to “do what you love”—
not as a disingenuous apology for accepting exploitation, but as a real
description of the state of existence. This is Marx as stoner philosopher:
just do what you feel, man (from each according to his ability), and it’ll all
be cool (to each according to his needs).</p><p>Marx’s critics have often turned this passage against him, portraying it
as a hopelessly improbable utopia. What possible society could be so
productive that humans are entirely liberated from having to perform
some kind of involuntary and unpleasant kinds of labor? The last chapter
suggested the possibility of widespread automation that could enact such a
liberation or at least approach it—if, that is, we find a way to deal with the
need to secure resources and energy without causing catastrophic
ecological damage.</p><p>Recent technological developments have taken place not just in the
production of commodities, but in the generation of the energy needed to
operate the automatic factories and 3-D printers of the future. Hence one
possible postscarcity future combines labor-saving technology with an
alternative to the current energy regime, which is ultimately limited by
both the physical scarcity and ecological destructiveness of fossil fuels.
This is far from guaranteed, but there are hopeful indicators for our ability
to stabilize the climate, find sources of clean energy, and use resources
wisely. These will be discussed further in Chapter 3.</p><p>But with the scarcity problem solved, would we all just sit around in
dissipation and torpor as in WALL-E? Not if, as Marx put it, “labor has
become not only a means of life but life’s prime want.” Whatever
activities and projects we undertook, we would participate in them because
we found them inherently fulfilling, not because we needed a wage or
owed our monthly hours to the cooperative. This is hardly so implausible
in many areas, considering the degree to which decisions about work are
already driven by nonmaterial considerations, among those who are
privileged enough to have the option: millions of people choose to become</p><p>teachers or social workers, or start small organic farms, even when far
more lucrative careers are open to them.</p><p>The demise of wage labor may seem like a faraway dream today, but it
was once the dream of the Left. The labor movement used to demand
shorter hours rather than higher wages. People expected the future to look
like the cartoon The Jetsons, whose protagonist works two hours per week,
and they actually worried about what people would do after being liberated
from work. In the essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,”
John Maynard Keynes predicted that within a few generations,</p><p>man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—how to use his freedom from
pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound
interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.8</p><p>And In a discussion from 1956, the Marxist philosopher Max Horkheimer
begins by casually remarking to his comrade Theodor Adorno that
“nowadays we have enough by way of productive forces; it is obvious that
we could supply the entire world with goods and could then attempt to
abolish work as a necessity for human beings.”9</p><p>Work and Meaning</p><p>Getting past wage labor economically also means getting past it socially,
and this entails deep changes in our priorities and our way of life. As in
Vonnegut’s day, there are those who argue that even if a fully automated
future is possible, it would not be desirable. They think that the inherent
meaningfulness of work is the best argument against automation. They
point to studies showing that unemployment has serious negative
psychological and health implications for the unemployed, as evidence of
the positive value of work beyond the wage it confers.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that when we talk about “work” in the
context of a capitalist society, we can mean three different things. It can be
the way we earn the money we need to survive; it can be some activity
that’s necessary for the continued existence of our society; and it can be
some activity that we find inherently fulfilling, because it gives purpose
and meaning to our lives. For some lucky few, it can be all three. But for
many of us, it is simply the way we earn a wage, something we’d be happy</p><p>to be free of if we could—as shown by the market for lottery tickets even
among those with supposedly “good” jobs.</p><p>Consider a study by three economists at the Free University of Berlin,
which suggests a more complicated reality behind claims that waged work
is a necessary source of a person’s dignity or meaning.10 In a summary of
their findings for a general audience, they begin by seemingly validating
the consensus perspective, noting that “people adapt surprisingly well to
changes in their lives,” but the unhappiness produced by unemployment is
an exception: “the life satisfaction of the unemployed does not restore
itself even after having been unemployed for a long time.”11</p><p>However, the authors go on to ask why the unemployed are so
persistently unhappy, and in doing so they clarify an ambiguity that always
arises when the effects of unemployment are discussed. Is unemployment
bad for people because the experience of working is good for them, or
because unemployment carries a powerful social stigma? (The question
leaves aside, of course, the most obvious reason for the unpleasantness of
being jobless—being broke.)</p><p>To determine why unemployment is bad for people, they examine the
change in self-reported life satisfaction among Germans who move from
being unemployed to being retired. The authors observe that “entering
retirement brings about a change in the social category, but does not
change anything else in the lives of the long-term unemployed.” Yet they
find that the shift from being unemployed to being retired brings about
immediate and dramatic increases in happiness, even when controlling for
other factors, thus demonstrating “how strongly long-term unemployed
people benefit from the change of their social category while retiring and
the associated relief from not having to meet the social norm of being
employed anymore.”12</p><p>The unemployed become happier, it turns out, as soon as they stop
thinking of themselves as workers. This result suggests that the harm
caused by unemployment has a lot to do with the way we, as a society,
regard the unemployed. We treat paying work as a sure mark of a person’s
worth, even though this conviction has no coherent rationale.</p><p>Some who may accept this argument will still argue that the problem
with transcending work is that some things simply shouldn’t be
automated, because to do so would be unacceptably dehumanizing or</p><p>degrading to our society in some way. It is one thing, in other words, to
automate a textile factory, but the prospect of robot nurses and diagnostic
computers displacing medical employees fills many people with horror.
Reacting to the possibility of robots providing caregiver services to the
elderly, sociologist Zeynep Tufekci deems the process “inhuman.”13 But it
turns out that it’s mostly the adoption of machines under conditions of
capitalism she objects to, the fear that that automation will only produce
unemployment and misery. I wrote this book in order to argue that another
way is possible.</p><p>She does, however, raise an important point. Care work like nursing is
predominantly performed by women and is not coincidentally undervalued
and underpaid. So perhaps the danger is less that such work will be
automated, but that it won’t, and an underpaid, feminized workforce will
be all that’s left of wage labor. Some parts of caregiving, the changing of
bedpans and the like, are the sort of unpleasant work that seems ideally
suited for automation. But many elderly people rely on a nurse for
emotional connection as much as for physical maintenance.</p><p>Still, even some of the more emotionally complex aspects of care
aren’t immune to replacement—if people take emotional comfort from
nonsentient animals, why not from robots? Often, what humans want is
simply to be around other beings that we can nurture and be loved by,
beings that return our affection in a lifelike way—even if they are not
sentient in the way humans are. Those without human companions will
thus often satisfy this desire through their relationships with their cat or
dog.</p><p>But why does that connection have to come from a human servant? For
those of us who didn’t grow up around animals, it’s not immediately
obvious what the difference is between a cute dog and a cute robot. And
likewise a robot nurse could be more comforting than an overworked and
exasperated human one. Not surprisingly, this approach is already being
developed in Japan, an aging society with deep expertise in the
technologies of cuteness and robotics.</p><p>However, Tufekci’s critique also touches on something more profound,
which goes beyond the questions of work and automation. This is what
Tufekci calls “deep emotional labor: taking care of each other.” Taking
care of each other, overcoming our isolation and loneliness, is at the
essence of being human. But is what we want a world where we are all</p><p>paid for that activity? Or one where we are freed from the need to work for
wages so we can explore what it means to take care of ourselves and one
another? My sympathies are with the second possibility and with the new
possibilities and problems that might unfold in such a world.</p><p>What happens if production requires very little human labor or none at
all? To see what such a society might look like, consider one of American
popular culture’s most well-known science fiction utopias: Star Trek. The
economy and society of that show is premised on two basic technical
elements. One is the technology of the “replicator,” which is capable of
materializing any object out of thin air, with only the press of a button.
The other is a fuzzily described source of apparently free (or nearly free)
energy, which runs the replicators as well as everything else on the show.</p><p>The Star Trek television shows and movies are, at one level, simply
adventure stories, space operas in which our heroes gallivant around the
galaxy in a metaphor of naval exploration. But beneath that facade, the
future society in which the show’s characters live is one beyond scarcity.
We could, indeed, call it a communist society, in the sense that Marx used
the term, a world run according to the principle “from each according to
their ability, to each according to their need.”</p><p>The show, especially in its second-run incarnation as Star Trek: The
Next Generation, periodically refers to this fact and pokes fun at our lowly
present world of money and commodities. In one episode, Captain Jean-
Luc Picard encounters a man from the twentieth century, who has been in
suspended animation for 400 years. Picard must patiently explain to this
bewildered newcomer that his society “eliminated hunger, want, the need
for possessions.” And one of the alien species in the show, the Ferengi, are
the perennial butt of jokes for their barbaric attachment to capitalism and
material accumulation.</p><p>The communistic quality of the Star Trek universe is often obscured
because the films and TV shows are centered on the military hierarchy of
Starfleet, which explores the galaxy and comes into conflict with alien
races. But even this seems to be largely a voluntarily chosen hierarchy,
drawing those who seek a life of adventure and exploration; to the extent
that we see glimpses of civilian life, it seems mostly untroubled by
hierarchy or compulsion. And to the extent that the show departs from
communist utopia, it is because its writers introduce the external threat of
hostile alien races or scarce resources in order to produce sufficient</p><p>dramatic tension. The rest of the time, the show’s conflict turns on the
quest to “live wisely and agreeably and well.” There are many such
conflicts to imagine, as we will see.</p><p>Is This My Beautiful Life?</p><p>Before saying more about what the important conflicts and categories of a
communist society might be, a word about how we might get there.
Hostility to automation is widespread, even among those who are drawn to
its potential, because they do not see how to achieve that potential without
leaving most people behind. That is, if we could go from being wage
workers to being taken care of by automated production, that would be
wonderful, but it seems more likely that we’ll just end up unemployed and
destitute, beholden to those who own the machines.</p><p>I share Marx’s aversion to recipes for the kitchens of the future, so I
won’t attempt some kind of programmatic account of the transition to
communism. I’ll merely suggest some basic principles.</p><p>We should not assume that the end of capitalism necessarily involves
some grand revolutionary movement that merely bides its time and builds
strength, before seizing the state and the means of production at one stroke
—the model of Bolshevik and other insurrectionist revolutionaries. That’s
not to say, however, that some kind of dramatic rupture won’t ultimately
be necessary; it would be naïve to think that the holders of wealth and
power will relinquish it voluntarily. But since we are a long way from
being able to force such a reckoning, we can think in the meantime about
strategies that build the alternative to capitalism before it is completely
overturned. This means giving people the ability to survive and act
independently of capitalist wage labor in the here and now, while at the
same time facilitating their ability to gather and organize themselves
politically.</p><p>The social-democratic welfare state is often thought of as the
antithesis to the revolutionary project. If twentieth-century communism
was about the violent overthrow of the capitalist class, the story goes,
social democracy as it developed in Western Europe and elsewhere was
just about ameliorating capitalism’s worst aspects, providing a minor
safety net to protect people from the vicissitudes of the market. But</p><p>though it can be that, the welfare state has a more radical edge as well. The
effect of the welfare state, at its most universal and generous, is to
decommodify labor—in other words, to create a situation in which it
possible to survive without depending on selling your labor to anyone who
will pay for it.</p><p>The decommodification of labor is a concept developed by the
Swedish sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen in his influential 1990 treatise
on the modern welfare state, The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism.14
He proposed that one of the major axes along which different national
welfare regimes varied was the degree to which they decommodified labor.
The motivation for this idea is the recognition (going back to Marx) that
under capitalism people’s labor-power becomes a commodity, which they
sell on the market in order to earn the means of supporting themselves.
For most of us, our labor is in fact the only thing we have to sell, and
selling it is the only way to get by.</p><p>Esping-Andersen describes the decommodification of labor as the
situation in which you can procure your basic needs—housing, health care,
or just money—without having to take a job and without having to satisfy
any bureaucratic condition. To the extent that you get these things simply
as a right of being a citizen, rather than in return for doing something,
your labor has been decommodified.</p><p>So long as the society remains a capitalist one, it is never possible for
all labor to be totally decommodified, because in that case nothing would
compel workers to take a job working for someone else, and capital
accumulation would grind to a halt. Capitalism doesn’t work unless bosses
can find a pool of workers who have no choice but to accept the jobs they
offer. However, insofar as there are programs like unemployment
protection, socialized medicine, and guaranteed income security in
retirement—and insofar as eligibility for these programs is treated as a
universal right—we can say that labor has been partially decommodified.
On the basis of this argument, Esping-Andersen differentiates those
welfare regimes that are highly decommodifying (such as the Nordic
countries) from those in which workers are still much more dependent on
the market (such as the United States).</p><p>And there are those who argue that certain kinds of reforms,
particularly those that decommodify labor, can point in more radical
directions. The French socialist André Gorz is responsible for a well-</p><p>known theorization of this idea. In one of his early works from the late
1960s, Strategy for Labor, he attempted to do away with the tired Left
debate over “reform or revolution” and replace it with a new distinction.15
Socialists had argued endlessly, as they do to this day, about whether it was
possible to use the machinery of elections and policy reforms to overcome
capitalism, or whether only a violent seizure of power would do. To Gorz,
this was a false debate and a distraction from the real issue:</p><p>Is it possible from within—that is to say, without having previously destroyed capitalism
—to impose anti-capitalist solutions which will not immediately be incorporated into and
subordinated to the system? This is the old question of “reform or revolution.” This was
(or is) a paramount question when the movement had (or has) the choice between a
struggle for reforms and armed insurrection. Such is no longer the case in Western
Europe; here there is no longer an alternative. The question here revolves around the
possibility of “revolutionary reforms,” that is to say, of reforms which advance toward a
radical transformation of society. Is this possible?16</p><p>Gorz goes on to distinguish “reformist reforms,” which subordinate
themselves to the need to preserve the functioning of the existing system,
from the radical alternative:</p><p>A non-reformist reform is determined not in terms of what can be, but what should be.
And finally, it bases the possibility of attaining its objective on the implementation of
fundamental political and economic changes. These changes can be sudden, just as they
can be gradual. But in any case they assume a modification of the relations of power;
they assume that the workers will take over powers or assert a force (that is to say, a non-
institutionalized force) strong enough to establish, maintain, and expand those tendencies
within the system which serve to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints. They assume
structural reforms.17</p><p>One of Gorz’s examples of a nonreformist reform is now commonly
known as the universal basic income. This is simply the proposal to grant
every person a guaranteed amount of money that they would receive
absolutely unconditionally, irrespective of work or any other qualification.
The grant would ideally be set high enough to allow people to live at a
level of basic decency whether or not they work.</p><p>This is obviously a radical proposal, given that it subverts the typical
insistence by both liberals and conservatives that social benefits be tied to
work in some way or else be targeted at particular constituencies like the
elderly and people with disabilities. There is an extensive debate on the
practicalities of the proposal—how to pay for it, of course, but also what</p><p>programs it should replace. Replacing unemployment insurance or welfare
checks is one thing, but replacing health care coverage with a flat payment
is more problematic, because different people have wildly different needs
for health care services. But here I am more concerned with utopian
speculation about the possible social effects of a universal basic income.</p><p>One criticism of the basic income is that it will not be systemically
viable over the long run, as people increasingly drop out of paid labor and
undermine the tax base that funds the basic income in the first place. But
from another point of view, this prospect is precisely what makes basic
income a nonreformist reform. Thus one can sketch out a more
programmatic kind of utopianism that uses the basic income as its point of
departure. One gesture in this direction is Robert van der Veen and
Philippe van Parijs’s 1986 essay, “A Capitalist Road to Communism.”18</p><p>The essay begins from the proposition that Marxism’s ultimate end is
not socialism but rather a communist society that abolishes both
exploitation (that is, people getting paid less than the true value of their
work) and alienation, much like Marx’s “realm of freedom” discussed
above: “productive activities need no longer be prompted by external
rewards.”19</p><p>Suppose, they say, “that it is possible to provide everyone with a
universal grant sufficient to cover his or her ‘fundamental needs’ without
this involving the economy in a downward spiral. How does the economy
evolve once such a universal grant is introduced?”20</p><p>Their answer is that the basic income would “twist” the capitalist drive</p><p>to increase productivity:</p><p>Entitlement to a substantial universal grant will simultaneously push up the wage rate for
unattractive, unrewarding work (which no one is now forced to accept in order to
survive) and bring down the average wage rate for attractive, intrinsically rewarding work
(because fundamental needs are covered anyway, people can now accept a high-quality
job paid far below the guaranteed income level). Consequently, the capitalist logic of
profit will, much more than previously, foster technical innovation and organizational
change that improve the quality of work and thereby reduce the drudgery required per
unit of product.21</p><p>If you extrapolate this trend forward, you reach a situation where all wage
labor is gradually eliminated. Undesirable work is fully automated, as
employers feel increasing pressure to automate because labor is no longer
too cheap. The reasoning here is that, as I argued in the last chapter, one of</p><p>the things holding back full automation of the economy isn’t that the
technical solutions are lacking, it’s that wages are so low that it’s cheaper
to hire humans than to buy machines. But with access to a basic income,
workers will be less willing to accept unpleasant and low-paying jobs, and
employers will have incentive to find ways to automate those jobs.</p><p>Meanwhile, the wage for desirable work eventually falls to zero,
because people are both willing to do it for free and able to do so because
a basic income supplies their essential needs. As Gorz puts it in a later
work, Critique of Economic Reason, certain activities “may be partially
repatriated into the sphere of autonomous activities and reduce the
demand for these things to be provided by external services, whether
public or commercial.”22</p><p>The long-run trajectory, therefore, is one in which people come to
depend less and less on the basic income, because the things they want and
need do not have to be purchased for money. Some things can be produced
freely and automatically, as 3-D printing and digital copying technologies
evolve into something like Star Trek’s replicator. Other things have
become the product of voluntary cooperative activity rather than waged
work. It therefore comes to pass that the tax base for the basic income is
undermined—but rather than creating an insoluble crisis, as in the hands
of basic income critics, the withering away of the money economy, and its
corresponding tax base, becomes the path to utopia.</p><p>Consider, for example, a basic income that is linked to the size of GDP.
We are used to a capitalist world in which the increase in material
prosperity corresponds to a rise in GDP, the measured value of economic
activity in money. But as wage labor comes to be replaced either by
automation or voluntary activity, GDP would begin to fall, and the basic
income with it. This would not lead to lowered standards of living,
because the falling GDP here also denotes a decline in the cost of living.
Just like the socialist state withers away in certain versions of traditional
Marxism, the basic income withers away. As Van der Veen and Van Parijs

can imagine that we live in a communist society. So now we return to the
more human question: in a communist society, what do we do all day? The
kind of communism I’ve described is sometimes mistakenly construed, by
both its critics and its adherents, as a society in which hierarchy and
conflict are wholly absent. But rather than see the abolition of the capital-
wage relation as a singleshot solution to all possible social problems, it is
perhaps better to think of it in the terms used by political scientist Corey
into ordinary
Robin, as a way
unhappiness.”24</p><p>to “convert hysterical misery</p><p>For it is surely not the case that all hierarchies and conflicts, even now,
can be reduced to the logic of capital. At the same time, so long as most
people are dependent on wage labor, it is also impossible to completely
separate any given conflict from that fundamental one. Rather than
thinking of the capital relation as the root from which all oppression and
conflict grows, perhaps a better metaphor would be that the conflict
between capital and labor shapes other social relations the way a magnetic
field influences the objects around it.</p><p>In a common lesson about electromagnetic forces, students are given
an exercise in which a bar magnet is placed on a table surrounded by
scattered iron filings. The invisible field surrounding the magnet will draw
the filings into alignment with it, until the swirling starburst shape of the
field becomes visible. The capital relation is a kind of social magnet, with
capital at one end and labor at the other, that tends to align all other social
hierarchies with the master hierarchy based on money. Hence the hierarchy
of athletic ability is translated into a hierarchy of payment for performing
professionally. And yet the magnetism of capital is not so strong that it can
perfectly align all the systems. Fame, for example, may in general be
translatable into money (as when Kim Kardashian releases a smartphone
game that becomes wildly successful), but the conversion is not an exact
or uniform one. And while money can also buy fame, it may not always be
of the sort intended, as teenager Rebecca Black discovered when her
mother paid $4,000 for a music video so cringe-inducing and terrible that
it became a viral media sensation.25</p><p>The most interesting questions about communist society pertain to the
operation of status competitions of various kinds, after the organizing
force of the capital relation has been removed. And once again, fiction is a</p><p>helpful illustration. This time, however, it is not necessary to conjure
starships and aliens in order to imagine the tribulations of a communist
future.</p><p>Cory Doctorow’s 2003 novel Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom
imagines a postscarcity world that is set in a recognizable extrapolation of
the present day United States.26 Just as in Star Trek, material scarcity has
been superseded in this world, which is run according to the principle of
“ad-hocracy,” a sort of anarchism in which society is run by groups that
form and disperse without being subject to any overarching hierarchy. But
Doctorow grasps that within human societies, certain immaterial goods
will always be inherently scarce: reputation, respect, esteem among one’s
peers. Thus, the book revolves around various characters’ attempts to
accumulate “Whuffie,” which are virtual brownie points that represent the
goodwill you have accumulated from others (think of a generalized form
of Facebook upvotes or Twitter retweets). The people in the book believe
that, as the main character says at one point,</p><p>Whuffie recaptured the true essence of money: in the old days, if you were broke but
respected, you wouldn’t starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could
buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented—your
personal capital with your friends and neighbors—you more accurately gauged your
success.27</p><p>Of course, that description of “the old days” isn’t really a very accurate
picture of the way capitalist society works, as demonstrated by the joke
about the journalist who takes assignments for free from editors who
promise her increased attention and prestige: she died of “exposure.”
Being able to endure survival independent of Whuffie or any other
currency makes all the difference in the world.</p><p>The book’s story mostly takes place in Disneyland, which in the
postwork society is now run by volunteers. But there still needs to be some
hierarchy and organization, which is determined according to Whuffie.
The drama of the story turns on the various intrigues and conflicts that
result. Without having to worry about survival—or death, given this
book’s cheery assumption that the dead can be easily resurrected from a
backup—other conflicts present themselves, like whether Disneyland’s
hall of presidents should include a display that interfaces with your brain
to give you the experience of being Abraham Lincoln. These debates are</p><p>resolved not by who has the most money, but by who can acquire the
highest social status.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time on social media, this might all sound more
terrifying than utopian. But that’s the value of Doctorow’s book, in
contrast to Star Trek: it treats a postscarcity world as one with its own
hierarchies and conflicts, rather than one in which all live in perfect
harmony and politics comes to a halt. Reputation, like capital, can be
accumulated in an unequal and self-perpetuating way, as those who are
already popular gain the ability to do things that get them more attention
and make them more popular. Moreover, racism and sexism don’t
disappear when capitalism does; they can stratify postcapitalist societies
as well. Such dynamics are readily observable today, as blogs and other
social media produce popular gatekeepers; some are able to get attention
and some are not, in a way that is not completely a function of who has
money to spend. Organizing society according to who has the most “likes”
on Facebook has certain drawbacks, to say the least, even when dislodged
from its capitalist integument.</p><p>The same dynamics play out in the Wikipedia project, which provides
another example of the sort of struggles that transcend the specificity of
capitalism. In principle, Wikipedia bills itself as “the encyclopedia that
anyone can edit,” a perfectly democratic and flat institution. In practice, it
is neither so structureless nor so egalitarian. Partly this is because it
reinscribes the inequalities of the society around it: a disproportionately
large number of editors are white men, and the content of Wikipedia
reflects this. With only 13 percent female contributors according to a 2010
survey, things like feminist literature get lesser coverage than minor
characters from The Simpsons.</p><p>So ending capitalism, and even ending patriarchy and racism, won’t
end the possibility for conflict. Differences of opinion, conflicts of
interest, and personality clashes will exist in any conceivable world. And
while Wikipedia is not run like a traditional encyclopedia or a capitalist
business, it still has a hierarchy. It has a complex bureaucracy of
administrators, editors, and moderators, with varying power to bypass
screening procedures, block users, delete articles, move files, and other
site functions.</p><p>Such structures were developed to protect against vandalism and
malicious attempts to defame others or rewrite history by those with a</p><p>they have also had</p><p>the effect of
self-interested motivation. But
discouraging new editors, preventing Wikipedia from expanding or
diversifying its editor base. A study in the journal American Behavioral
Scientist found that the number of Wikipedia’s editors dropped from
50,000 in 2006 to 35,000 in 2011. The authors of the study quipped that
Wikipedia had become “the encyclopedia that anyone who understands the
norms, socializes him or herself, dodges the impersonal wall of semi-
automated rejection and still wants to voluntarily contribute his or her
time and energy can edit.”28</p><p>Bitcoins, Doges, and Whuffie</p><p>A contemporary reader of Doctorow’s book may find that the concept of
“Whuffie” resonates more than it used to, because of the renewed
prominence of invented nonstate currencies—in particular, the distributed
cryptocurrency Bitcoin. As an accounting system that maintains an
artificially scarce points system that is nevertheless not tied to the
traditional money and banking system, it is of some limited economic
interest. But it turns out that Bitcoin, for all its media hype, may be less
significant than some other alternative currencies that currently lack its
pretentions.</p><p>The partisans of Bitcoin aspire for it to substitute for capitalist money.
This means it must mediate exchanges of physical goods and services and
be a store of value that can make claims on those goods and services. In
other words, in order to convince people to take Bitcoins as payment, you
have to convince them that Bitcoins are worth something and will continue
to be worth something in the future.</p><p>Many Bitcoin evangelists believe that because it is not created or
regulated by the state, Bitcoins are somehow a more stable store of value.
This quixotic fixation—little different, in substance, from an older
generation of cranks’ obsession with the gold standard—has led the
Bitcoin subculture to naïvely recapitulate the unregulated financial
systems of the nineteenth century, with all their crises, crashes, swindles,
and panics. The wild fluctuations in the currency’s value belie the
Bitcoiners’ faith, as does the fact that several prominent Bitcoin
exchanges have collapsed and made off with their clients’ wealth, leaving</p><p>their victims with no recourse, a consequence of the lack of standards and
regulation.</p><p>The rediscovery of the need for central banking and government
regulation is good for a laugh at the expense of a gaggle of libertarian
young men, but it tells us little about the future. Bitcoin is not the only
cryptocurrency, however, even though it has the most exchange value in
traditional currencies, and has certainly been the most widely promoted.
Innumerable rivals exist, based on slight variations of the Bitcoin code,
going by names like Litecoin and Quarkcoin. Many of these are
opportunistic rivals driven by speculators. They are little better than
traditional stock market pump-and-dump scams, in which a few promoters
talk up the value of a company so that others will bid up its price, and then
sell off their own holdings before the suckers realize what’s happening.
For
interesting
this chapter, however,
cryptocurrency is the one that is generally regarded as a silly joke:
Dogecoin. In its rise and fall we can see a promising mechanism that may
have been introduced prematurely into a society that was not ready for it.</p><p>the purposes of</p><p>the most</p><p>Dogecoin takes its name from a viral Internet meme featuring a picture
of a Shiba Inu dog surrounded by enthusiastic, ungrammatical
exclamations. By the time of publication, readers of this book may not
even remember it. And the same may be true of Dogecoin, which was
launched at the peak of both Bitcoin and Doge’s popularity in late 2013.
Yet the community that arose around it tells us something important about
the real significance of the entire class of alternative moneys.</p><p>Measured in terms of its value in US dollars, Dogecoin never
threatened Bitcoin. But that was never relevant for the currency’s core use.
Within a few months of its inception, there were more daily unique
transactions in Doges than Satoshis (as Bitcoins were sometimes called in
homage to their mysterious inventor).29 And that’s because Dogecoin
satisfied a need for a different kind of currency, far removed from the
traditional capitalist sort and in fact more similar to Whuffie.</p><p>Technically, Dogecoin and Bitcoin are nearly identical, but that’s a
misleading picture of Dogecoin’s significance. The sociology of
Dogecoin’s community is very different, as is the problem to which
Dogecoin provides a solution.</p><p>To understand Dogecoin, you have to understand what people mostly
do with the currency. While people do sometimes buy valuable goods with</p><p>it, the most common use is “tipping”: the practice of transferring a small
number of Dogecoins to another Internet user in appreciation of their witty
or helpful contribution. This is encouraged by the fact that a single
Dogecoin was only worth a tiny fraction of a cent in US currency.</p><p>Tipping in Dogecoins became particularly common on Reddit and
Twitter, which developed easy-to-use platforms for executing these
transfers. In this, the Dogecoin tip extends the practice of upvoting on
Reddit or retweeting on Twitter—except that it converts those practices
into a common currency, a form of status that’s portable from site to site.
Rather than attempting to replicate traditional currencies, Dogecoin is a
way of bridging reputational karma across many separate domains.</p><p>During the initial flurry of interest, much of the media attention
viewed Dogecoin through the prism of Bitcoin. There was an emphasis on
its role as a speculative asset and a store of offline monetary value and
much hand-wringing about whether it would be able to hold its exchange
value in terms of traditional currency. And ultimately, that may be the
death of it. At this writing, the Dogecoin community is in crisis, largely
because of the hegemonic influence of a single large investor attempting
to turn it into a Bitcoin-like speculative vehicle that can be cashed in for
traditional money.30</p><p>All in all, the lesson of Dogecoin, and of the world of Internet cultures
and hierarchies that it represents, is a lesson about the complexity of any
utopia. Taking away money and scarcity as the master code organizing our
lives doesn’t make them simple or boring, because humans are far too
complex for that. If anything, it makes life unimaginably more
complicated. But it should still, I think, be regarded as a utopia, especially
by comparison to what is described in the next chapter.</p><p>This may all seem like a disappointing sort of utopia, grasping for
Whuffie and battling Wiki bureaucracies. Doctorow himself has said that
Whuffie “would make a terrible currency” and that the world he created is
really a very dark one, precisely because of the way reputational
economies can start to replicate the magnetic master-hierarchy quality of
capitalist currencies.31</p><p>But I would still argue that the communist society I’ve sketched here,
though imperfect, is at least one in which conflict is no longer based on
the opposition between wage workers and capitalists or on struggles over</p><p>scarce resources. It is a world in which not everything ultimately comes
down to money. A communist society would surely have hierarchies of
status—as do capitalist and all societies. But in capitalism, all status
hierarchies tend to be aligned, albeit imperfectly, with the master
hierarchy of capital and money. The ideal of a postscarcity society is that
various kinds of esteem are independent, so that the esteem in which one
is held as a musician is independent of the regard one achieves as a
political activist, and one can’t use one kind of status to buy another. In a
sense, then, it is a misnomer to refer to this as an “egalitarian”
configuration; it is not, in fact, a world that lacks hierarchies but rather
one of many hierarchies, no one of which is superior to any other.</p><p>2
RENTISM: HIERARCHY
AND ABUNDANCE</p><p>Charles Stross’s 2005 novel Accelerando begins in the twentyfirst century,
not too long from now.1 The protagonist, Manfred Macx, finds himself
facing down enforcers for the Copyright Control Association of America,
a “Mafiya” that is on his tail for the unauthorized digital distribution of
copyrighted material. Facing armed guards and a restraining order, he
slips the noose only by a clever and convoluted set of corporate legal
manipulations that he undertakes on the spot.</p><p>The notion of armed thugs apprehending people for distributing data
over the Internet has only gotten less far-fetched since the novel was
written. Macx’s brilliant, idealistic hacker character now evokes the
memory of Aaron Swartz, the activist and programmer who killed himself
in 2013 at age twenty-six. Swartz was facing crippling legal fees, massive
fines, and as much as thirty-five years in prison, all for the crime of
downloading too many articles from an academic database. Unlike
Manfred Macx, he couldn’t see a way out.</p><p>This chapter is centrally about intellectual property and the laws that
protect it—such as the laws that Swartz was charged under. If the previous
chapter was about the utopian possibility of a society of pure abundance,
this chapter is about what happens when that possibility is present but
stymied by ossified class structures and the state powers that defend them.
As we will see, intellectual property and the rents that flow to it are the
central categories of that dystopia.</p><p>Politics and Possibility</p><p>A characteristic failure of most mainstream economic discussions is their
presumption that if human labor in production becomes technically
unnecessary, then it will inevitably disappear. However, the system of
capital accumulation and wage labor is both a technical device for
efficient production and a system of power. Having power over others is,
for many powerful people, its own reward. Thus, they will endeavor to
maintain a system where others serve them, even if such a system is, from
a purely productive standpoint, totally superfluous. This chapter therefore
discusses how the current economic elite could maintain their power and
wealth in an environment of total automation.</p><p>“Who owns the robots,” says Harvard University labor economist
Richard Freeman, “owns the world.”2 Hence the alternative to the
communist society of our last chapter is one where the techniques to
produce abundance are monopolized by a small elite. The concept of
ownership, however, takes on a different texture in a highly automated
world. When we talk about “owning the robots,” we’re not just talking
about having control over a physical bundle of metal and wires. Rather,
the phrase metaphorically describes control over things like computer
software, algorithms, blueprints, and other kinds of information that are
need to produce and reproduce the world we live in. In order to maintain
control over the economy, then, the rich increasingly need to control that
information, and not just physical objects.</p><p>All of this leads to the system described in this chapter, which relies
heavily on the laws of intellectual property. Unlike physical property,
intellectual property dictates not only rights to the possession of physical
objects but also control over the copying of patterns. It can thus persist in
a world where, for example, most objects can be cheaply and easily copied
on 3-D printers. Those who control the most copyrights and patents
become the new ruling class. But this system is no longer capitalism as we
have traditionally understood it. Because it is based on the extraction of
rents rather than the accumulation of capital through commodity
production, I refer to it as “rentism.”</p><p>The Art of Rent</p><p>I use the term “rent” in a technical sense, following in the tradition that
goes back to classical economists like Ricardo and was picked up by
Marx. Originally, it referred specifically to the payments to the owners of
land, which were distinguished from other kinds of payments that could
flow to property owners. The most important insight is that the land itself
wasn’t produced by anyone. The crops grown on the land, or the factory
built on it, might be produced by people, but there is value in the land
itself that comes as a gift of nature. Whoever can claim ownership of that
land can therefore demand payment simply for controlling access to
property rather than doing anything with it.</p><p>The original theory of “ground-rent” to landowners was developed in
the context of a society that was still dominated by agriculture. In a
modern economy, the concept of rent must be broadened and made more
abstract. There are many other ways that property can generate income
without any action by the owner. The owner of this type of property is not
what we traditionally think of as a capitalist, but rather a “rentier,” a term
that first came into widespread use to describe the owners of government
bonds in nineteenth-century France, who were able to live off interest
payments; these people were neither workers nor bosses. In his 1893 book
Old and New Paris, the English journalist Henry Sutherland Edwards
compared the rentier to “the man retired from business.”3</p><p>The old-fashioned rentier was generally portrayed as someone of
modest wealth. This image survives today as the coupon-clipping retiree
surviving on a fixed income, a figure commonly invoked by those who
decry low government and bank interest rates. In reality, however, income
from rents is largely monopolized by a small number of rich people, as
becomes clear when the full range of rent-bearing assets is examined.
Rents accrue not just to land and government bonds but to distributed
stock portfolios and, increasingly, to intellectual property, to which we will
return.</p><p>The existence of rents and rentiers has always been something of an
embarrassment to the defenders of capitalism. Defending the necessity of
the boss who controls the means of production is easier, since ideologists
can at least claim that they do something, whether it’s organizing
production or coming up with products, or merely taking economic risks.
But rentiers create nothing, make nothing, do nothing; they just passively
accept the rewards of ownership. Thus, there have historically been calls</p><p>to tax away the rents from merely owning property, as opposed to the
profits that come from doing something with it.</p><p>There</p><p>intellectual</p><p>is an entire</p><p>tradition, originating with</p><p>the
nineteenth-century economist Henry George, that makes this policy
central to its theories and proposals. In his 1879 book Progress and
Poverty, George insisted that “the true remedy” to the problem of income
inequality was nothing more or less than to “make land common
property,” thus eliminating the largest source of rents that existed in his
day.4 His contemporary followers similarly argue that since land “is not
the product of human labor, but … is needed for all production,” all rents
on privately owned land should be appropriated through taxation and used
for the common good.5</p><p>The existence of rentiers also troubled the great economist John
Maynard Keynes. In a famous section of his treatise The General Theory
of Employment, Interest, and Money, he discusses the rate of interest—that
is, the return to owning capital—and argues that “interest today rewards
no genuine sacrifice, any more than does the rent of land.”6 Interest, he
thought, merely rewarded the owners of scarce productive resources. He
hoped and called for “the euthanasia of the rentier, of the functionless
investor,” which he believed would be possible when society had become
wealthy enough that those resources were no longer scarce.7</p><p>Scarcity and Property</p><p>Scarcity is central to the questions being asked in this book. Being the
technocratic liberal that he was, Keynes believed that if paying interest to
property owners couldn’t be justified by scarcity, then it should and would
disappear. From his perspective, the only reason to have a capitalist
market economy in the first place was to allocate scarce goods in a
circumstance where everyone couldn’t simply have as much as they want.
If rent serves no economic purpose, then why should it exist?</p><p>But this neglects the power struggle that is at the heart of a society
based on private property. From the perspective of property owners, it
matters very little whether their wealth is justified for some reason of
economic theory or social welfare. They simply want to keep their</p><p>property. And just as important, they want that property to maintain its
value.</p><p>Here something of a digression on the nature of property itself is in
order. Before you can understand what makes some piece of property
valuable, you have to know what makes it property in the first place. For
partisans of capitalism, it is often convenient to pretend that property is
some naturally occurring fact, but it is a really a social construction that
must be delineated and enforced by the power of the state. And the very
idea that all of the physical and social world can be divided up into
discrete parts, each tagged with the name of an owner, is a part of
capitalism’s ideological infrastructure that had to be painstakingly
constructed over many years.</p><p>This point is frequently illustrated with a discussion of early English
capitalism and what’s known as the “enclosure of the commons.” In
medieval times, land was frequently treated as a commonly held resource
which local residents could freely use for purposes such as mowing for
hay or grazing livestock. The “enclosure” of this land originally referred
to the literal fencing off of parcels to prevent access, but it also refers to
the process by which land was legally transformed from something to
which the community had a right of access into private property under the
control of large landowners, who were free to exclude others from using it.
Struggles over the commons in land continue today. The Movement of
Landless Rural Workers in Brazil, which helped bring the leftist Lula
government to power in 2003, built its power by demanding that unused
private land should be taken away from its private owners and treated as a
common good, in keeping with the Brazilian constitution’s stipulation that
“property shall fulfill a social function.” And some enterprising
businessmen are already trying to enclose land even beyond the Earth.
Writing in Dissent in 2014, Rachel Riederer reports on Bigelow
Aerospace, which has requested government approval for “a ‘zone of
noninterference’ around their future lunar operations.”8 The moon’s
surface may yet be enclosed: the spacefaring nations of the world never
ratified the 1979 Moon Treaty, which would have banned ownership of any
part of the lunar surface.</p><p>For the most part, however, the total privatization of land is mostly
taken for granted today, at least in the rich countries. The debate over how</p><p>to define the meaning and scope of property continues in other ways,
especially in the debate over so-called intellectual property.</p><p>The very definition of intellectual property demonstrates what a
malleable concept “property” can be. While its defenders tend to speak of
it as though it is broadly analogous to other kinds of property, it is actually
based on a quite different principle. This irks even some conservative
libertarian economists, like Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine. In their
book Against Intellectual Monopoly and other works, they observe that
intellectual property rights mean something quite different from property
rights in land or physical objects.9</p><p>The right to intellectual property is ultimately not a right to a concrete
thing but to a pattern. That is, it does not just protect “your right to control
your copy of your idea” in the way that it protects my right to control my
shoes or my house. Rather, it grants the right to tell others how to use
copies of an idea that they “own.” As Boldrin and Levine say,</p><p>This is not a right ordinarily or automatically granted to the owners of other types of
property. If I produce a cup of coffee, I have the right to choose whether or not to sell it
to you or drink it myself. But my property right is not an automatic right both to sell you
the cup of coffee and to tell you how to drink it.10</p><p>This form of property is by no means new. The writer’s copyright has been
a part of English law since 1710, and the United States Constitution
explicitly delineates the government’s right “to promote the Progress of
Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and
Inventors
respective Writings and
to
Discoveries.” But the significance of intellectual property has increased,
and it promises to continue increasing as the physical productivity of the
economy grows.</p><p>the exclusive Right</p><p>their</p><p>In an echo of the struggle over enclosure, there are ongoing fights over
the expansion of intellectual property into more and more areas. Fashion
designers have historically not been able to copyright their designs in the
United States, but large designers and their legislative allies are pushing
bills that would allow them to sue the makers of cheap knockoff dresses
and shoes. More ominous is the move to extend intellectual property
protection to nature itself. In the 2013 decision Bowman v. Monsanto Co.,
the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Vernon Bowman, an
Indiana farmer who had been found guilty of violating patents held by the</p><p>agribusiness giant Monsanto.11 His crime was to plant seeds from a crop
of soybeans that contained genetically modified “Roundup Ready” genes
that made them resistant to herbicide. The decision affirmed Monsanto’s
ability to force farmers to buy seeds anew every year, rather than use the
seeds from the previous year’s crops.</p><p>them. Until regulators</p><p>In other cases as well, the property rights to physical objects are being
transformed because of the immaterial, intellectual property claims
associated with
issued a 2010 exemption,
provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act apparently made it
illegal for owners of Apple’s iPhone to “jailbreak” the device in order to
install new software on it. Similar litigation has revolved around the right
of owners to modify the software that runs in modern cars and other
vehicles. The John Deere Company, for example, has argued to
government officials that it is illegal for farmers to make modifications or
repairs to the software that runs their tractors. This is, they say, because
nobody actually owns their tractor—they merely have “an implied license
… to operate the vehicle.” Thus does the property form mutate, so that
even something as tangible as a tractor becomes not the physical property
of its buyer, but merely a pattern to be licensed for a limited time.</p><p>All of this means that intellectual property is becoming an increasingly
important component of the property held by the capitalist class. When we
talk about the global “1 percent” and their wealth, we aren’t just talking
about owning land or factories or Scrooge McDuck’s swimming pool of
gold coins. We’re talking about stocks and bonds whose value, in many
cases, is backed by immaterial, intellectual forms of property.</p><p>In a 2013 report released by the European Patent Office, “[intellectual
property–]rights intensive industries” were said to make up 39 percent of
European Gross Domestic Product, and a whopping 90 percent of
exports.12 Similarly, the US Commerce Department estimates that
intellectual property–intensive industries account for 35 percent of US
GDP, a number that will only continue to rise.13 This includes obviously
intellectual property–dependent businesses like pharmaceuticals and
entertainment as well as things like apparel manufacturing, where the
value of a Nike trademark can easily eclipse that of the physical shoe it is
sewn onto. Even that seemingly most material of trades, the oil business,</p><p>can in some cases be viewed as “intellectual property–intensive” due to
the large numbers of patents held by companies like Shell.</p><p>Nor has the significance of intellectual property been lost on the
repressive apparatus of the state. In a 2010 article in Foreign Affairs, US
Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn discussed the military’s
“cyberstrategy” explicitly in terms of the value of intellectual property to
American corporations.14 He predicted
to
intellectual property is less dramatic than the threat to critical national
infrastructure, it may be the most significant cyberthreat that the United
States will face over the long term” and warned that “sustained intellectual
property losses could erode both the United States’ military effectiveness
and its competitiveness in the global economy.”15</p><p>that while “the</p><p>threat</p><p>It’s worth stopping to contemplate what Lynn is referring to when he
talks about “losses” of intellectual property. Google, he reports, “disclosed
that it had lost intellectual property as a result of a sophisticated operation
perpetrated against its corporate infrastructure.”16 In other words,
someone accessed its computer network and copied something that he or
she wasn’t entitled to copy. But presumably Google still had the
information; it is unlikely that the hackers deleted it from the servers and
that no backups had been kept. Describing this as a “loss” appropriates the
same word that would be applied to physical property, but this is at best a
metaphorical extension. What is really being talked about is the
unauthorized copying of patterns, and the only thing being lost is potential
future corporate revenue.</p><p>Obscuring this distinction is a common gambit of intellectual property
maximalists, and it can have terrible human consequences. Vernon
Bowman, the Indiana farmer who lost his case against Monsanto, faces
$85,000 in damages. Those pursued for the unauthorized downloading of
music have faced life-crippling fines, like the $220,000 charged against
Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe employee Jammie Thomas-Rasset for sharing
twenty-four songs. And then of course there is Swartz, martyred by a
careerist prosecutor and an out-of-control intellectual property system.</p><p>Anti–Star Trek</p><p>As we have seen in the earlier chapters, Star Trek provides a fable of an
egalitarian, postscarcity society. But what does that look like without the
egalitarianism? In other words, given the material abundance made
possible by the replicator, how would it be possible to maintain a system
based on money, profit, and class power?</p><p>Economists like to say that capitalist market economies work
optimally when they are used to allocate scarce goods. So how to maintain
capitalism in a world were scarcity can be largely overcome? This requires
a kind of antithesis of the Star Trek universe, which takes the same
technical preconditions and casts them in a different set of social relations.
As noted above, intellectual property differs from other property
because it grants rights not just over concrete objects but over patterns and
all copies and uses of those patterns. And the entire infrastructure of Star
Trek is based on patterns that are fed into the replicator and used as the
basis for fabricating a physical object, just as a blueprint provides the
guidelines for building a house.</p><p>This is the quality of intellectual property law that provides an
economic foundation for anti–Star Trek: the ability to tell others how to
use copies of an idea or pattern that you “own.” So imagine that unlike
Star Trek, we don’t all have access to our own replicators. And that in
order to get access to a replicator, you would have to buy one from a
company that licenses you the right to use it. You can’t get someone to
give you a replicator or make one with their replicator, because that would
violate their license and get them in legal trouble. What’s more, every
time you make something with the replicator, you also need to pay a
licensing fee to whoever owns the rights to that particular thing. Captain
Jean-Luc Picard customarily walks to the replicator and requests “tea, Earl
Grey, hot.” But his anti–Star Trek counterpart would have to pay the
company that has copyrighted the replicator pattern for hot Earl Grey tea.
(Presumably some other company owns the rights to cold tea.)</p><p>Ellis’s</p><p>turn-of-the-millennium</p><p>Something like the anti–Star Trek world is seemingly portrayed in
series
Warren
Transmetropolitan. The story centers around hard-boiled journalist Spider
Jerusalem as he makes his way through the grimy, violent, and hedonistic
world some unspecified time into the future. Spider has a “maker,” which
seems to be something like a replicator, although quite a bit odder and</p><p>comic</p><p>book</p><p>more unpredictable. And in addition to raw material, Spider must wait for
a new season of “maker codes” in order to replicate new things.</p><p>The anti–Star Trek model solves the problem of how to maintain for-
profit capitalist enterprise, at least on the surface. Anyone who tries to
supply their needs from their replicator without paying the copyright
cartels would become an outlaw, Aaron Swartz or Jammie Thomas-Rasset.
But if everyone is constantly being forced to pay out money in licensing
fees, then they need some way of earning money, and this brings up a new
problem. With replicators around, there’s no need for human labor in any
kind of physical production. So what kind of jobs would exist in this
economy? Here are a few possibilities.</p><p>There will be a need for a “creative class” of people to come up with
new things to replicate, or new variations on old things, which can then be
copyrighted and used as the basis for future licensing revenue. But this is
never going to be a very large source of jobs, because the labor required to
create a pattern that can be infinitely replicated is orders of magnitude less
than the labor required in a physical production process in which the same
object is made over and over again. What’s more, it’s very hard to make
money in creative fields even now. So many people want to do this work
that they will bid each others’ wages down to subsistence levels. And lots
of people will create and innovate on their own, without being paid for it.
The capitalists of anti–Star Trek would probably find it more economical
to pick through the ranks of unpaid creators, find new ideas that seem
promising, and then buy out the creators and turn the idea into the firm’s
intellectual property.</p><p>In a world where the economy is based on intellectual property,
companies will constantly be suing each other for alleged infringements of
others’ copyrights and patents, so there will be a need for a lot of lawyers.
This will provide employment for some significant fraction of the
population, but again it’s hard to see this being enough to sustain an entire
economy, particularly because of a theme that we saw in the introductory
chapter: just about anything can, in principle, be automated. Watson,
IBM’s Jeopardy-playing computer program, is already automating the
work of lower-level law firm staff. And it’s easy to imagine big
intellectual property firms coming up with procedures for mass-filing
lawsuits that rely on fewer and fewer human lawyers, just as there are now
systems that detect copyrighted music in online videos and send requests</p><p>for removal. On the other hand, perhaps an equilibrium will arise where
every individual needs to keep a lawyer on retainer, because no one can
afford the cost of auto-lawyer software but they must still fight off
lawsuits from firms attempting to win big damages for alleged
infringement.</p><p>As time goes on, the list of possible things you can replicate will only
grow, but people’s money to buy licenses—and their time to enjoy the
things they replicate—will not grow fast enough to keep up. Thus
marketing will become more important, because the biggest threat to any
given company’s profits will not be the cost of labor or raw materials—
they don’t need much or any of those—but rather the prospect that the
licenses they own will lose out in popularity to those of competitors. So
there will be an unending and cut-throat competition to market one
company’s intellectual properties as superior to the competition’s: Coke
over Pepsi, Ford over Toyota, and so on. This should keep a small army
employed in advertising and marketing. But once again, there is the
specter of automation: advances in data mining, machine learning, and
artificial intelligence may lessen the amount of human labor required even
in these fields.</p><p>Finally, any society like the one I have described, which is predicated
on maintaining great inequalities of wealth and power even when they
have become economically superfluous, will require a large amount of
labor to prevent the poor and powerless from taking a share back from the
rich and powerful. The economists Samuel Bowles and Arjun Jayadev call
this type of labor “Guard Labor” and define it as “the efforts of the
monitors, guards, and military personnel … directed not
toward
production, but toward the enforcement of claims arising from exchanges
and the pursuit or prevention of unilateral transfers of property
ownership.”17 It includes private security guards, police officers, the
military, prison and court officials, and weapons producers. An estimated
5.2 million guards worked in the United States in 2011.18</p><p>These would be the main source of employment in the world of anti–
Star Trek: creators, lawyers, marketers, and guards. It seems implausible,
however, that this would be sufficient—the society would probably be
subject to a persistent trend toward under-employment. Especially if all
the sectors except (arguably) the first would be subject to pressures toward
innovation. Even high-level managerial
labor-saving</p><p>technological</p><p>functions can be partly automated: in 2014, a Hong Kong venture capital
fund called Deep Knowledge appointed an algorithm, a program called
VITAL, to its board, where it receives a vote on all investments.19</p><p>And perhaps even “creativity” isn’t such a uniquely human talent (if
we reduce that word to the creation of replicator patterns). In a paper
presented to a 2014 conference of the Association of Computing
Machinery, a group of medical researchers presented a method for
automatically generating plausible hypotheses for scientists to test, using
data mining techniques.20 Such approaches could eventually be applied to
other formulaic, iterative processes like the design of pop songs or
smartphone games.</p><p>What’s more, there is also another way for private companies to avoid
employing workers for some of these tasks: turn them into activities that
people will find pleasurable and will thus do for free on their own time.
The computer scientist Luis von Ahn has specialized in developing such
“games with a purpose”: applications that present themselves to end users
as enjoyable diversions but which also perform a useful computational
task, what von Ahn calls “Human Computation.”21</p><p>One of Von Ahn’s early games asked users to identify objects in
photos, and the data was then fed back into a database that was used for
searching images, a technology later licensed by Google to improve its
Image Search. Later, he founded Duolingo, a company that provides free
language training exercises and makes money by inviting its users to
practice their language skill translating documents for companies that
have paid for this service. Perhaps this line of research could lead toward
something like Orson Scott Card’s novel Ender’s Game, in which children
remotely fight an interstellar war through what they think are video
games; indeed, the infrastructure for such a thing already exists, in the
form of remote-operated drone bombers.22 But that scenario is more
appropriately revisited in Chapter 4, the chapter on exterminism.</p><p>For all these reasons, it seems that the main problem confronting the
society of anti–Star Trek is the problem of effective demand: that is, how
to ensure that people are able to earn enough money to be able to pay the
licensing fees on which private profit depends. Of course, this isn’t so
different from the problem that confronted industrial capitalism, but it
becomes more severe as human labor is increasingly squeezed out of the</p><p>system, and human beings become superfluous as elements of production,
even as they remain necessary as consumers.</p><p>even</p><p>require</p><p>capitalist</p><p>Ultimately,</p><p>self-interest will</p><p>some
redistribution of wealth downward in order to support demand. Society
reaches a state in which, as the French socialist André Gorz put it in his
1999 book Reclaiming Work: Beyond the Wage-Based Society, “the
distribution of means of payment must correspond to the volume of wealth
socially produced and not to the volume of work performed.”23 Or, to
translate from French Intellectual to English: you deserve a decent
standard of living because you’re a human being and we’re a wealthy
enough society to provide it, not because of any particular work that you
did to deserve it. So in theory, this is one possible long-term trajectory of a
world based on intellectual property rents rather than on physical
commodity production using human labor. What Gorz is talking about is
something like the universal basic income, which was discussed in the last
chapter. Which means that one long-run trajectory of rentism is to turn
into communism.</p><p>But here the class of rentier-capitalists will confront a collective action
problem. In principle, it would be possible to sustain the system by taxing
the profits of profitable firms and redistributing the money back to
consumers—possibly as the universal basic income, but possibly in return
for performing some kind of meaningless make-work. But even if
redistribution is desirable from the standpoint of the class as a whole, any
individual company or rich person will be tempted to free-ride on the
payments of others and will therefore resist efforts to impose a
redistributive tax. Of course, the government could also simply print
money to give to the working class, but the resulting inflation would just
be an indirect form of redistribution and would also be resisted. Finally,
there is the option of funding consumption through consumer indebtedness
—but this merely delays the demand crisis rather than resolving it, as all
of us know all too well.</p><p>This all sets the stage for ongoing stagnation and periodic economic
crisis in the world of anti–Star Trek. And then, of course, there are the
masses. Would the power of ideology be strong enough to induce people to
accept the state of affairs I’ve described? Or would people start to ask why
the wealth of knowledge and culture was being enclosed within restrictive</p><p>laws, when “another world is possible” beyond the regime of artificial
scarcity?</p><p>3
SOCIALISM: EQUALITY AND SCARCITY</p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson’s California Trilogy is a triptych of novels, each of
which envisions a possible future for Robinson’s home state of
California.1 The first novel, The Wild Shore, portrays the simple
agricultural life of the survivors of a nuclear war, a tale that might fit into
the next chapter on exterminism. The second, The Gold Coast, is a J. G.
Ballardian dystopia of freeways, condos, and malls, perhaps a rentist
dystopia if anything.</p><p>But the third, Pacific Edge, is something of an ecological postcapitalist
utopia, and the one Robinson himself says he would most like to live in. It
recounts the story of people living in the Los Angeles region and
attempting to reconstruct its concrete jungle into something greener and
cleaner. Robinson calls it an “attempt to think about what would it be like
if we reconfigured the landscape, the infrastructure, the social systems.”2
In that, it captures the spirit of the third ideal type of society: socialism, an
egalitarian society that must work together to rebuild its relationship to
nature.</p><p>In Pacific Edge, our world of multinational capitalism has given way
to something more socialist, and ecologically sensitive, but without being
a total primitivist rejection of modern technology. People govern
themselves on a small scale and work together to build a sustainable
economy. However, our society has left behind a lot of damage to be
repaired. The tensions in the narrative revolve around the need, as
Robinson put it in an interview, “to restore that landscape to something</p><p>decently livable.”3 That doesn’t mean somehow recovering nature as it
was before human intervention, but rather working out a new relationship
between people and their environment; a major plot point turns on whether
a wilderness area should be left totally wild or adapted to human use. In
general, the struggle is over how to recognize and control the waste
products of human civilization, rather than imagining that we can ever
separate ourselves from nature.</p><p>Early in the book, two characters are digging up an old street so that
the asphalt can be sent away for recycling. Encountering an apparently
superfluous traffic signal, they have this exchange:</p><p>The air warmed as the morning passed. They ran into a third traffic light box, and Doris
scowled. “People were so wasteful.”</p><p>Hank said, “Every culture is as wasteful as it can afford to be.”
“Nah. It’s just lousy values.”
“What about the Scots?” Kevin asked. “People say they were really thrifty.”
“But they were poor,” Hank said. “They couldn’t afford not to be thrifty. It proves my</p><p>point.”</p><p>Doris threw dirt into a hopper. “Thrift is a value independent of circumstances.”
“You can see why they might leave stuff down here,” Kevin said, tapping at the traffic</p><p>boxes. “It’s a bitch to tear up these streets, and with all the cars.”</p><p>Doris shook her short black hair. “You’re getting it backwards, Kev, just like Hank.
It’s the values you have that drive your actions, and not the reverse. If they had cared
enough they would have cleared all this shit out of here and used it, just like us.”</p><p>“I guess.”4</p><p>My description of a communist society in Chapter 1 shows a world like
the one in Pacific Edge but without the constraints of scarcity and
ecological devastation. The way I portrayed that world implicitly agrees
with Hank: they’re as wasteful as they can afford to be, and the technical
basis of that society means it doesn’t have to worry too much about
conservation. This chapter is about what happens when you do have to
figure out how to live within your means while providing everyone the
best lives possible.</p><p>Capitalism and Scarcity</p><p>The political economy of capitalism has been concerned with the problem
of scarcity since its inception, but never in a constant or consistent way. In
particular, there has always been an understandable fear that capitalism’s</p><p>dynamic of endless and accelerating growth will collapse when faced with
the depletion of the inputs to that growth, whether those are energy inputs
like coal and oil or raw materials like wood and iron. But while scarce
resources have impinged on capitalist development at various points
throughout its history, this has repeatedly happened in ways that caught
theorists of the system by surprise.</p><p>Writing at the turn of the eighteenth century, Thomas Malthus worried
that the limits of agricultural productivity, combined with the inevitable
propensity of the poor to reproduce, meant that it was impossible to
achieve both population growth and increasing economic prosperity. To
this day, those who claim that capitalism is ultimately constrained by the
carrying capacity of the earth are popularly referred to as “Malthusians,”
even if the particular forms of scarcity they point to are very different than
those Malthus was interested in.</p><p>Malthus’s view turned out not to account for the factors that have
allowed the Earth to sustain a much larger population at higher living
standards than were possible 200 years ago, beginning with increases in
agricultural productivity. However, the general theme of material limits to
growth recurs in both mainstream and critical left-wing treatments of
capitalism.</p><p>Stanley Jevons, one of the progenitors of modern mainstream
economics, became preoccupied with an issue that is still central to
industrial and postindustrial economies: energy scarcity. In his 1865 book
The Coal Question, Jevons analyzed British economic growth and its
dependence on tapping coal reserves.5 He projected that within less than a
century, economic growth would have to stall as coal production peaked
and declined. Moreover, he saw efforts at energy conservation as
inevitably doomed. Making the case for what came to be known as the
“Jevons paradox,” he argued that increased energy efficiency would
simply lead to more energy consumption because the cheaper power would
be used more.</p><p>What Jevons could not have known was that, while his assessments of
coal reserves were broadly correct, the advanced capitalist economies
would soon shift their energy base to petroleum. Readers today, however,
may be familiar with the modern counterpart to Jevons’s speculations, the
theory of “peak oil.” Originating with the mid-twentieth century geologist
M. King Hubbert, this theory uses reasoning similar to Jevons’s. Noting</p><p>the approaching peak and decline in easily accessible reserves, peak-oil
theorists claim that the world is heading into a period of inevitable
economic stagnation resulting from the exhaustion of oil reserves. The
theory gained credence when Hubbert’s prediction that the United States
would hit peak oil in the 1970s largely came true.6</p><p>Like Jevons on coal, peak oil depends on the idea that it is impossible
to transition the economy away from oil and onto some combination of
other, less limited energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric,
natural gas, and nuclear power. But we now have an additional and more
pressing imperative: even if oil reserves were unlimited, we know that
burning hydrocarbons has introduced irreversible changes to the Earth’s
climate, with dire consequences for human civilization. Some of the
changes are irreversible and must simply be adapted to. But it is
nevertheless urgent that we reduce carbon emissions massively, in order to
head off more apocalyptic scenarios.</p><p>As Christian Parenti has argued in his many works on the climate
crisis, large-scale transformation on a very short time scale is necessary if
we want to preserve a decent and livable world for the whole of humanity.
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that to
avoid catastrophic global feedback loops and tipping points, rich countries
must cut their carbon emissions by as much as 90 percent by 2050. The
severity of the challenge and the short time to act mean that, as Parenti
says, “it is this society and these institutions that must cut emissions.”7
This challenge falls far short of overthrowing capitalism and yet still
entails the monumental challenge of bringing down the powerful interests
that profit from destructive fossil fuels.</p><p>Beyond Dystopia</p><p>The real question is not whether human civilization can survive ecological
crises, but whether all of us can survive it together, in some reasonably
egalitarian way. Although the extinction of humanity as a result of climate
change is possible, it is highly unlikely. Only somewhat more plausible is
the collapse of society and a return to some kind of premodern new Dark
Ages. Maintaining a complex, technologically advanced society no doubt
requires a large number of people. But it does not necessarily require all 7</p><p>billion of us, and the premise of this book is that the number of people
required is on the decline because of the technical developments outlined
in Chapter 1.</p><p>For this reason, we should not take at face value the farcical “debate”
about the existence of climate change that persists in mainstream media
and politics, particularly in the United States. Debating the reality of
human-caused climate change is no longer relevant or productive. Those
who deny climate science do not genuinely reject that science, but they are
indifferent to its impact. They are, in other words, people who are
sufficiently rich and powerful that they believe they can escape even the
worst case scenarios while imposing their costs on the rest of the
population, so long as our current social structure is maintained. Hence,
they are properly to be considered in the next chapter, on exterminism.</p><p>Because climate change and ecological destruction are inescapable, the
only relevant question is how we organize a response. The premise of this
chapter is that problems of resource scarcity and ecological limitations
can’t be waved away easily. (In the chapter on communism, by contrast,
the argument could be made that resource and ecological limitations could
ultimately be transcended through better technology.) University of Utah
political economist Minqi Li, for example, has written of the massive
infrastructural transformations that will be needed to move the world to a
renewable energy base. “The construction of power plants and other
electricity facilities,” he writes, “requires not only financial resources, but
also workers, technicians and engineers with special skills and expertise,
as well as equipment and materials that have to be produced by specialized
factories.”8 This entails some kind of centralized, state-driven project that
can mobilize resources and labor in a way that is beyond the capabilities
of either the free market or the communist free-for-all of Chapter 1.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important not to become trapped in fables of
apocalypse, a nihilist resignation and a belief that nothing can be done.
There has always been such an apocalyptic streak on the Left. This is
somewhat understandable, given the current state of our politics: in
technical terms, we can identify actions that have a hope of staving off
disaster, but these seem so gigantic in scale, and the political obstacles so
great, as to be practically impossible. We could undertake a green New
Deal that would replace our carbon-based energy system with wind, solar,
and other renewable sources. We could build high-speed trains and other</p><p>mass transit to replace the gas-burning automobile as the center of our
transportation system. We might even be able to remediate some of the
worst impacts of the carbon emissions that are currently ongoing, through
the technologies of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration.</p><p>But who is going to fund that, and how will the bill get through
Congress? The prospects in the short term seem bleak. Thus, it can be
perversely reassuring to think that achieving a better world is not just
difficult, but actually impossible.</p><p>Anyone whose social network includes ecologically minded liberals
has no doubt seen the spread of various reports of climate catastrophe,
accompanied by the implicit or explicit idea that we are all doomed. Many
of the findings coming from climate science are genuinely terrifying—the
rapid shrinking of the West Antarctica ice sheet, for example, which is
occurring far more rapidly than anyone expected even a few years ago. But
even such epochal events, which are occurring almost instantaneously in
geological terms, will unfold over decades or centuries. That’s an eternity
in terms of human society. So while it’s hard to imagine human society
dealing with environmental changes of this magnitude, it’s no more
outlandish than picturing the regimes of 1914 reckoning with the
upheavals of the past century. Two world wars! Industrialized genocide!
Nuclear weapons! It would probably reduce a socialist of an earlier
generation to tears; a Rosa Luxemburg might conclude that humankind has
succumbed to barbarism already, making any hope of socialism little more
than a pipe dream.</p><p>Yet we have muddled through, for better or for worse. The bigger
danger—as we will see in the next chapter—is not that we simply fall off
the climate cliff together. It is that human civilization does adjust to the
climate catastrophe, but in a way that only carves out a comfortable
existence for a tiny ruling class, cocooned in their bubbles of wealth
strewn around a wider world of deprivation.</p><p>Fatalism is the perfect complement to the equally inane positivity that
pervades bourgeois discourse. That can come in the form of self-help
positive-thinking bromides, as dissected by Barbara Ehrenreich in her
book Bright-Sided.9 She notes that the power of positive thinking is, all
too often, promoted as a palliative, a way of resigning oneself to a
negative reality rather than questioning and resisting it. Think and Grow
Rich was the title of an early classic of the self-help genre, and its basic</p><p>message has been propagated by various hucksters in a lineage that
stretches all the way down to the Oprah Winfrey–promoted bestseller The
Secret.10 Unfortunately, positive thinking doesn’t bring about utopia any
more than negative thinking brings about the apocalypse.</p><p>Another version of this creed is the phony utopianism of Silicon Valley
plutocrats. From Facebook to Uber, these new-school robber barons
shimmer with self-satisfaction as they insist that the market will solve all
our problems and deliver prosperity to all, if we would only get out of the
way and stop insisting on our petty labor standards and market regulations.
The whole charade is an evasion of politics, whether undertaken in the
guise of the utopian right or the nihilistic Left. The ruling class tells us
that the future is inevitably bright; left-leaning curmudgeons reassure
themselves that the future is inevitably gloomy. The result: the Left take
meager emotional satisfaction from being right while our opponents take
their payment in a more tangible form.</p><p>Loving Our Monsters</p><p>Suppose that we can meet the immediate short-term challenge and stave
off catastrophic climate change. And suppose, further, that we can
transform our class-stratified society into something more egalitarian,
where all are able to take advantage of the fruits of technology, and where
labor in production is, if not totally unnecessary, relatively minimal. We
will still be dealing with the ecological consequences of capitalism, many
of which are now locked in and inevitable. And we will have to reconstruct
everything, from our cities to our transportation networks to our power
grids, in line with a new way of relating to the ecosystem. In order to
consider what kind of social system could take up this task, it’s worth
stopping to characterize the relationship between humans and nature in
any future postcapitalist world.</p><p>Considerations of ecology often tend toward a duality between humans
—and their technologies—and nature. Talk of “conservation” or of
reducing our “carbon footprints” implies that nature exists in some
pristine state and that the task of humans is to withdraw from nature in
order to save it. This way of thinking is ultimately a denial of humans as
natural, biological beings, inseparably a part of nature—just as much so,</p><p>in its way, as those forms of transhumanism that yearn to upload
consciousness into computers in order to be free of the organic world
altogether.</p><p>The view that nature exists in some stable, timeless equilibrium in the
absence of human interference betrays a profound misunderstanding of the
physical world, which is characterized by disequilibrium, disruption, and
constant change. Natural history was full of overpopulation, die-off,
extinction, and climate change long before humans appeared on the scene.
If you view ecology as the project of preserving an unchanging nature,
then you’ll inevitably wind up as an apocalyptic nihilist: there is no way to
preserve nature as-is or restore it to some pristine state, at least not while
also preserving human societies.</p><p>it simply exists. A postapocalyptic</p><p>In the end, nature doesn’t care about us; it has neither interests nor
desires;
terrain populated by
cockroaches and rats is an ecological system just the same as a bountiful
and verdant world populated by every creature on Noah’s ark. Who but we
humans is to say that one is better than the other? Any attempt to maintain
climate, or ecosystems, or species is ultimately undertaken because it
serves the needs and desires of humans, either to directly sustain us or to
preserve features of the natural world that increase the quality of our lives.
The reason to avoid a future where we live in sealed domes surrounded by
lifeless devastation is that this would be a horrible way to live. Even if
some environmentalists may just want to save the whales, that too comes
down to the priority they place on being able to live in a world with whales
in it. As for the most extreme forms of “deep ecology,” which view
humanity as a plague on nature that deserves to be eradicated, these only
reduce human-centered ecology to an absurdity in the attempt to escape it,
as they project their own nihilism onto an uncaring world.</p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars Trilogy can be read as a critique and
explication of the difference between human-centered ecology and nature
worship. The books follow the first colonists on Mars, over a struggle
lasting hundreds of years to terraform the planet for human habitation. In
the first book (Red Mars), the planet is still barely touched, while by the
final book (Blue Mars) it is covered with vegetation, rivers, and seas.11
Those who support this process—the destruction of the original Martian
environment—are known as “greens,” while those who endorse keeping
the planet in its original form—and hence unfit for human habitation—are</p><p>“reds.” Here the human task of shaping the natural world around our needs
is separated from the impulse to preserve particular natural environments
for their own sake.</p><p>Back here on Earth, the ecologist Eugene Stoermer and others have
proposed that we live in an era that should be called the “Anthropocene,”
the period of geological time in which humans have had a major impact on
the Earth’s ecosystems. Some leftist ecologists are suspicious of this term,
viewing it as a way of blaming ecological damage on humans in general
rather than on capitalists in particular.12 But it doesn’t have to be that; the
Anthropocene can simply be a recognition that ecology must always
revolve around human concerns. The question, in other words, is not how
we reduce our impact on nature, but how we can better manage and care
for nature.</p><p>The French sociologist Bruno Latour has made the same observation
through his reading of Mary Shelley’s seminal science fiction tale,
Frankenstein. This story is not, he observes, the warning against
technology and humanity’s hubris that it is so often made out to be.13 The
real sin of Frankenstein (which is the name of the scientist and not the
monster) was not in making his creation but in abandoning it to the
wilderness rather than loving and caring for it. This, for Latour, is a
parable about our relationship to technology and ecology. When the
technologies that we have created end up having unforeseen and terrifying
consequences—global warming, pollution, extinctions—we recoil in
horror from them. Yet we cannot, nor should we, abandon nature now. We
have no choice but to become ever more involved in consciously changing
nature. We have no choice but to love the monster we have made, lest it
turn on us and destroy us. This, says Latour, “demands more of us than
simply embracing technology and innovation”; it requires a perspective
that “sees the process of human development as neither liberation from
Nature nor as a fall from it, but rather as a process of becoming ever-more
attached to, and intimate with, a panoply of nonhuman natures.”14</p><p>To take one small example, consider the “RoboBee” project currently
being pursued at Harvard University. Their aim is to produce tiny robots
that can mimic the actions of insects, in a collaboration that includes
biologists, roboticists, and engineers. Given the anxieties of our time,
many peoples’ first thoughts will tend toward the potential use of this</p><p>technology for military surveillance, a possibility that the project itself
touts on its website with no apparent discomfort. But this technology
could also be used to fill human-created holes in the ecosystem. By
pollinating plants, for example, robotic bees might be able to mitigate
some of the effects of the colony collapse disorder that has ravaged bee
populations in the United States since around 2006. This is a mysterious
phenomenon in which worker bees abandon their hives and leave behind
the queen and young to eventually die. Addressing such ecological
disorders with technical interventions will no doubt have unintended
consequences, as have all our prior modifications of the environment. But
as Latour observes, there seems little choice at this stage but to deepen our
engagement with nature.</p><p>Ecosocialism and the State</p><p>So how to better love our monsters? The reconstruction of society along
ecologically sustainable lines entails a significant role for governments
and other large organizations. When we were considering communism,
this could mostly be put aside, as people were left to freely associate and
pursue their desires without negatively affecting others. But learning to
live together on a damaged and resource-challenged planet requires
solutions at a larger scale.</p><p>First of all, of course, there is the need to mitigate the current sources
of climate change, the coal and oil power plants spewing carbon into the
atmosphere. Fortunately, solutions do exist, if the political obstacles can
be overcome. Although wind, tidal, geothermal, and tidal kinetic sources
of power are useful, solar power is probably the most significant long-
term alternative to fossil fuels. The sun is, of course, by far the best
potential source of energy available to Earth; by covering even a tiny part
of the surface with solar collectors, we could generate enormous amounts
of power. Moreover, solar technology has advanced rapidly from an
uneconomical novelty to a real alternative. In 1977, the price of solar
photovoltaic panels was $76.67 per watt; by 2013 it had fallen to $0.74 per
watt. And one of the major obstacles to large-scale solar power, the need
for new battery technology to store power when the sun isn’t shining, may
soon fall. In March 2016, the US government’s Advanced Research</p><p>Projects Agency-Energy announced a major breakthrough in this area,
with the potential to transform the existing energy grid.</p><p>Even nuclear energy may play some role. But this is likely to be
marginal, because of the high costs and long build times for nuclear
reactors, and in any case reliance on nuclear energy should be regarded as
an emergency stopgap because of its inherent risks. (The most significant
breakthrough in clean energy would be sustained nuclear fusion reactors,
which could generate enormous amounts of energy without the dangers
and toxic byproducts of current nuclear fission technology. But while
scientists can create fusion reactions in a lab, they are very far away from
being able to do so in a way that generates more energy than it consumes
—too far for inclusion even in a speculative work like this one,
particularly given the short time scale of the climate crisis.)</p><p>Simply phasing out dirty energy, though, will no longer be enough. We
will also have to take action to reverse some of what has already
happened, by removing carbon from the air. Some environmentalists
oppose such techniques of “carbon capture,” believing them to be ruses to
justify continued use of polluting energy sources. But a combination of
clean energy along with carbon capture and sequestration is the best hope
for a relatively benign transition out of the carbon energy era.</p><p>In addition to transforming the larger infrastructure, there is also the
need to reconstruct our daily lives. This entails replacing our sprawling
suburban metropolises with more densely packed locales, connected by
public transportation. But as we reconstruct the city, we shouldn’t neglect
the need to remake the countryside as well. Cramming everyone into dense
apartment blocks denies the need for space and greenery that in part
motivates the desire for suburban living. The space outside the cities
should be imagined not as an untouched wilderness, but more like Latour’s
description of the manmade nature of France’s national parks: “a rural
ecosystem complete with post offices, well-tended roads, highly
subsidized cows, and handsome villages.”15 All connected to the cities,
presumably, by clean high-speed rail.</p><p>The list of reconstruction needs goes on: adapting coastal areas to
increased flooding, for example, a process that is already underway as
Dutch engineers bring their centuries-long expertise to increasingly flood-
prone locales like New York. So how to marshal this labor, if we are
positing a world beyond the wage? Once again, of course, machinery and</p><p>automation go a long way. But insofar as humans are needed, some sort of
national service could replace the wasted labor that today is funneled into
the military apparatus.</p><p>The Market as Plan</p><p>Finally there is the issue of consumption. There will be a pressing need to
deal with scarcity, but not scarcity of labor or goods as in standard models
of capitalism. If we assume a truly perfect replicator, even agriculture can
be eliminated in favor of machine-made hamburgers, indistinguishable
from the real thing. Rather, it is the basic inputs to production—perhaps
water or other raw materials, or just energy—that must be rationed. This
requires some type of economic planning.</p><p>Planning was at the center of many of the key debates around
socialism in the twentieth century. Could the state plan every detail of
production for every consumer good? Should it merely control certain key
industries? Could the market be used to coordinate production in a society
that still deserved the name “socialist”?</p><p>Planning also appears in much science fiction that attempts to theorize
a postscarcity society. Ken MacLeod’s novel The Cassini Division takes
place in a twenty-fourth century in which humanity has colonized the solar
system and formed several distinct societies, one of which is known as the
Solar Union; at one point the author describes their “Babbage engines
churning through their Leontiev material-balance matrices.”16 The name
of Wassily Leontiev, who will return in the next chapter, evokes the era of
Soviet planning as portrayed in Francis Spufford’s Red Plenty—a
speculative fiction about the past, which fictionally dramatizes the
attempts of mathematician Leonid Kantorovich to find a mathematically
tractable way to run a planned economy.17</p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2312 describes a system by which “the total
annual economy of the solar system could be called out on a quantum
computer in less than a second.”18 Quantum computing is a long-pursued
dream of computer science, which posits that the principles of quantum
mechanics can be used to build computers that are orders of magnitude
faster than the ones we have today. Robinson’s allusion, therefore, is to
machines that could solve the incredibly complex problems of economic</p><p>planning that were simply beyond the reach of Soviet-era technology. In a
nod to Red Plenty, the economic system is referred to as the “Spuffordized
Soviet cybernetic model.”19 And in yet another inside leftist joke,
Robinson says the system is alternately known as the “Albert-Hahnel
model.” This refers to the Left economic theorists Michael Albert and
Robin Hahnel, whose “participatory economics” framework attempts to
devise a system of economic planning that is responsive to the needs of
individuals rather than vesting planning decisions in a bureaucracy.</p><p>Planning is clearly on the minds of many who want to imagine a
postcapitalist future society with a workable economy. Yet all these
examples are attempts to answer the old twentieth-century problem, the
problem of planning production. Whereas if we assume the replicator, as
in previous chapters, this is not really the problem. For consumer goods at
least, people can produce whatever they want, for themselves. However,
the resource-constrained future still faces the problem of managing
consumption. That is, we need some way of allocating the scarce inputs
that feed the replicator.</p><p>Here the universal basic income, introduced in Chapter 1, could be
useful once again. In the context we are describing in this chapter,
universal basic income plays a quite different function than wages in
capitalism. And it will work to ration and plan out consumption through
the mechanism of the market.</p><p>This might seem an odd thing to say, in a chapter titled “Socialism.”
And there are some socialists who see the market as inherently
incompatible with a desirable post-capitalism. For them, the market is a
fundamental component of what’s wrong with capitalism, and is a source
of atomization and alienation. Because markets use money and
commodities to mediate our relations with one another, this line of
argument goes, they are inherently less sociable and human than some
other way of organizing our economic life, such as engaging in barter,
self-sufficiently providing for our needs in a commune, or implementing a
fully planned economy in which all enterprise is socialized and decisions
about production and distribution are made through a political process.
And certainly this criticism has some merit, particularly in a capitalist
society in which market relations tend to permeate every aspect of our
lives and subject even the most personal decisions to impersonal forces.</p><p>But a market, for any one particular type of thing or service, can also
be considered as a technology, one with very different meanings and
effects depending on the larger social structure in which it is embedded. In
a society like ours, characterized by extreme concentrations of wealth and
income, the market allocates social power in proportion to money—thus
producing a society of “one dollar, one vote.”</p><p>Consider the example of companies like the car-sharing service Uber,
the errand-outsourcing website TaskRabbit, and the short-term rental
market AirBnB. All represent themselves as part of the “sharing
economy,” in which individuals make small exchanges of goods and
services under conditions of fundamental equality. The idea is that I might
rent out my apartment when I’m on vacation, and hire you to drive me
somewhere when you have the spare time, and that we all therefore end up
with a bit more convenience and a bit more money. In that case, nobody
has enough wealth and power to exploit anyone else, which would make
this a good example of what the sociologist Erik Olin Wright calls
“capitalism between consenting adults” who have equal power in the
marketplace.20</p><p>As they exist now, these companies really just demonstrate how
unequal and nonconsensual our current system is. They are unequal in two
different ways. There is inequality between the buyers and sellers of
services in these systems: people employed through TaskRabbit can do
little to challenge abusive or unreasonable demands for fear of being fired.
Many AirBnB properties are run by companies that are essentially
unlicensed hotel chains, not by individuals trying to let a spare room for a
few days. And the companies themselves, backed by major venture
capitalists, have power over buyers and sellers because they control the
platforms on which the exchange occurs and can change the rules at will to
maximize their profits. We see this starkly in the case of Uber, which has
provoked strikes and protests from its drivers over its tendency to
arbitrarily change their fares and working conditions.</p><p>But if we posit a world in which everyone is allocated the same basic
income and nobody has control over vast pools of wealth, this objection
disappears. Think of the basic income as the ration card that gives you
access to your share of all that is scarce in the world. Rather than allocate
specific amounts of each scarce resource, the pricing mechanism of the
market is used to protect against overuse.</p><p>To illustrate what this means, consider a mundane example: parking. In
American cities, street parking has traditionally been free in most areas or
available at a small fixed price. This is a dramatic underpricing, in the
sense that it leads people to overconsume the limited resource of parking
spaces, leading to a shortage of free spaces and many cars cruising around
looking for spaces. In some areas of New York, most of the traffic on the
streets is people looking for parking, wasting their time while creating
pollution and congestion.</p><p>As an alternative, some cities are experimenting with various schemes
for pricing street parking, often under the influence of UCLA parking
theorist Donald Shoup.21 One of Shoup’s key themes is that urban
governments should avoid under-pricing street parking, because to do so
leads to Soviet-style shortages as described above, along with tedious
rationing rules such as two-hour limits and the like.</p><p>Under the influence of this theory, the city of Los Angeles decided to
implement a wireless smart-metering system called LA Express Park.
Sensors are installed in the pavement below each space, and they detect
the presence of cars in a given area. The computerized system then
automatically adjusts the price of parking depending on how many spaces
are filled. When spaces are in high demand, the price can rise as high as $6
per hour, and when many spaces are available they can be as cheap as 50
cents.</p><p>The LA Express Park scheme has been widely discussed and promoted
as applying the “free market” to parking. This naturally grates on those of
the Left who equate the market with capitalism and with inequality. But in
this case talk of “markets” is more than just an ideological subterfuge to
further enrich the powerful; it gives some hints at the potential of markets
as limited technologies separable from capitalism.</p><p>Marxists have commonly made two objections to capitalist markets.
The first is narrowly economic: under the “anarchy” of capitalist
competition, the pursuit of private profit leads to unjust and irrational
results. Luxury goods are produced while the poor starve, inventories pile
up that no one can afford to buy, factories lie idle while thousands are
looking for work, the environment is despoiled, and so on. In Leon
Trotsky’s Transitional Program, in which he laid out a short term
reformist program for his communist followers, there are repeated
references to this kind of market anarchy, which will inevitably be</p><p>superseded by a superior form of rational, conscious, worker-controlled
planning. Indeed, says Trotsky, “The necessity of ‘controlling’ economy,
of placing state ‘guidance’ over industry and of ‘planning’ is today
recognized—at least in words—by almost all current bourgeois and petty
bourgeois tendencies, from fascist to Social Democratic.”22</p><p>Yet Trotsky himself was adamant that market mechanisms had to be a
part of planning the economy. In his 1932 critique The Soviet Economy in
Danger, he writes:</p><p>The innumerable living participants in the economy, state and private, collective and
individual, must serve notice of their needs and of their relative strength not only through
the statistical determinations of plan commissions but by the direct pressure of supply and
demand. The plan is checked and, to a considerable degree, realized through the
market.23</p><p>Seen from this perspective, the Los Angeles system is not a capitalist “free
market” deregulation. The city is not turning parking over to private
companies to compete for customers. The LA Express Park experiment is
in fact an exemplary case of central planning. The city begins by decreeing
a production target, which in this case is maintaining one empty parking
space on each street. The complex system of sensors and pricing
algorithms is then used to create price signals that will meet the target. In
a fundamental way, the capitalist market’s causal arrow has been reversed:
rather than market price fluctuations leading to an unpredictable level of
production, it is the production target that comes first, and the prices are
dictated by the quota.</p><p>There is another argument against markets. That they are not merely
anarchic and inefficient, but also induce ideological mystifications that
perpetuate capitalism and exploitation. The Marxist political scientist
Bertell Ollman has often argued this. “A major virtue of centrally planned
societies,” he says, is that “it is easy to see who is responsible for what
goes wrong.”24 This is a precondition for democratic accountability,
because “only a critique of market mystification will enable us to put the
blame where it belongs, which is to say—on the capitalist market as such
and the class that rules over it.”25</p><p>But this critique too fails. Despite the presence of price signals, and a
market, it is no mystery who is responsible for the new regime of
fluctuating meter prices: the city of Los Angeles, urged on by its adviser</p><p>Donald Shoup. Indeed, it is the very visibility of the planners that makes
projects like this controversial among those who take their right to free
parking for granted and who oppose policies like congestion pricing that
would mitigate traffic by charging drivers for entering busy areas. This is
also part of what makes climate policies such as a carbon tax vulnerable to
right-wing attack: whatever its “market-based” costume, everyone knows
that the policy begins with government lawmakers and bureaucrats.</p><p>The real failing of LA Express Park and all systems like it is that they
exist within a dramatically unequal capitalist society. In such a society, $6
for a parking space means less to a rich person than to a poor one, and so
the system is inherently unequal. The answer is not to attack the system of
market planning, but to overthrow that underlying inequality. Ultimately,
this means overcoming the capitalist system of resource distribution and
approaching a world in which control of wealth is equalized—that is,
where “the distribution of the means of payment” (to use Gorz’s phrase
cited in Chapter 2) is essentially equal.</p><p>But short of that, there are ways to turn some of the predatory “sharing
economy” businesses into something a bit more egalitarian. Economics
writer Mike Konczal, for instance, has suggested a plan to “socialize
Uber.”26 He notes that since the company’s workers already own most of
the capital—their cars—it would be relatively easy for a worker
cooperative to set up an online platform that works like the Uber app but is
controlled by the workers themselves rather than a handful of Silicon
Valley capitalists.</p><p>If we can tackle the inequalities that make our current market societies
so brutal, we might have a chance of deploying market mechanisms to
organize consumption in an ecologically limited world, allowing all of us
to come through capitalism and climate change as equals—“alive in the
sunshine,” as the eco-socialist and Jacobin magazine editor Alyssa
Battistoni says in a reference to Virginia Woolf.27</p><p>Socialism is a world of limits, but that doesn’t mean it can’t also be a
world of freedom. As discussed in Chapter 1, communism has limits as
well, but they are entirely internal to human social relations. Here, limits
are also imposed by the physical environment in which we live. We can
still reduce labor to a minimum, even if consumption must be bounded.
And what work of ecological reconstruction is necessary can be shared out</p><p>fairly rather than dictated by those with access to wealth. It may
sometimes be drudgery: we started this chapter, after all, with a story of
people ripping up asphalt for recycling, and having ripped up asphalt
myself, I can’t really recommend it. In other cases, though, the work we
do may be something that people find fulfilling and exciting. Whether it’s
designing robo-bees or parking algorithms, socialist ecology is full of
compelling challenges, a bit of communism in the eco-socialist future.</p><p>In other words, the socialist future can be as mundane as spending
one’s replicator rations and reporting for duty in the Ecological
Reconstruction Corps. Or it can be as grand as terraforming our own
planet, reconstructing it into something that can continue to support us and
at least some of the other living creatures that currently exist—in other
words, making an entirely new nature and ensuring that we still have a
place in it. This world may not have the giddy and improvisational feel of
the communist future, but it could still be a good place to live for
everyone—which is a lot more than can be said for the final future we will
examine.</p><p>4
EXTERMINISM: HIERARCHY
AND SCARCITY</p><p>Neill Blomkamp’s 2013 movie Elysium portrays a dystopian Earth in the
year 2154. A small elite—the 1 percent, if you will—has decamped for a
space station called Elysium. There, they enjoy lives of comfort and
leisure, lives that are apparently eternal due their access to miraculous
“Med-Bay” technology. Back on Earth, meanwhile, the rest of humanity
lives on a crowded, polluted planet, governed by a robotic police force.
The plot centers around Max (Matt Damon), one of the Earth-bound rabble
who has been poisoned by radiation, as he attempts to penetrate the
sanctum of Elysium and access its medical wonders.</p><p>The political economy of Elysium is somewhat difficult to extract
from the film, but some suggestive themes emerge. Most important is that
the rich on Elysium do not appear to be economically dependent on Earth
in any significant way. We do see a factory, where Max works in the
beginning of the movie and which is run by one of the Elysium elite. But
the purpose of that factory seems to be merely the production of weapons
and robots, whose purpose in turn is to control the population of Earth. For
the most part, the residents of Earth appear less like a proletariat than like
inmates of a concentration camp, where populations are warehoused rather
than exploited for their labor. The political economy of Elysium therefore
differs from that of, for example, The Hunger Games, in which the posh
lifestyles in the capital city of Panem are sustained by the surrounding
“districts” where the poor produce essential commodities.</p><p>The ending of Elysium suggests that perhaps the lifestyles of the rich
can be generalized to everyone, with luxury and immortality for all. This
is by no means unambiguous, however. In a previous chapter, I suggested
that if such a postscarcity society were to arise in the context of class
hierarchy, it would be more likely to take the form of a rentier economy
centered on intellectual property. Elysium looks like something different:
the fourth permutation of our axes of hierarchy-equality and scarcity-
abundance—that is, a world where scarcity cannot be totally overcome for
all but can be overcome for a small elite.</p><p>Communism for the Few</p><p>Ironically, the life enjoyed within Elysium’s bubble appears not too
different from the Communist scenario sketched out several chapters
earlier. The difference, of course, is that it is communism for the few. And
indeed, we can already see
in our
contemporary economy. As Charles Stross has noted, the very richest
inhabit a world in which most goods are, in effect, free. That is, their
wealth is so great relative to the cost of food, housing, travel, and other
amenities that they rarely have to consider the cost of anything. Whatever
they want, they can have.</p><p>this direction</p><p>tendencies</p><p>in</p><p>For the very rich, then, the world system already resembles the
communism described earlier. The difference, of course, is that their
postscarcity condition is made possible not just by machines but by the
labor of the global working class. But an optimistic view of future
developments—the future I have described as communism—is that we
will eventually come to a state in which we are all, in some sense, the 1
percent. As William Gibson famously remarked, “the future is already
here; it’s just unevenly distributed.”1</p><p>But what if resources and energy are simply too scarce to allow
everyone to enjoy the material standard of living that the rich enjoy today?
What if we arrive in a future that no longer requires the mass proletariat’s
labor in production but is unable to provide everyone with an arbitrarily
high standard of consumption? If we arrive in that world as an egalitarian
society, our system will resemble the socialist regime of shared
conservation described in the previous section. But if, instead, we remain a
society polarized between a privileged elite and a downtrodden mass, then</p><p>the most plausible trajectory leads to something much darker. The rich
will sit secure in the knowledge that their replicators and robots can
provide for their every need. What of the rest of us?</p><p>The great danger posed by the automation of production, in the context
of a world of hierarchy and scarce resources, is that it makes the great
mass of people superfluous from the standpoint of the ruling elite. This is
in contrast to capitalism, where the antagonism between capital and labor
was characterized by both a clash of interests and a relationship of mutual
dependence: the workers depend on capitalists as long as they don’t
control the means of production themselves, while the capitalists need
workers to run their factories and shops.</p><p>It was that interdependence, in fact, that gave hope and confidence to
many socialist movements of the past. The bosses may hate us, the
thinking went, but they need us, and that gives us power and leverage over
them. In the old labor and socialist standard “Solidarity Forever,” the
victory of the workers is inevitable because “they have taken untold
millions that they never toiled to earn, but without our brain and muscle
not a single wheel can turn.” With the rise of the robots, the second line
ceases to hold.</p><p>The existence of an impoverished, economically superfluous rabble
poses a great danger to the ruling class, which will naturally fear imminent
expropriation; confronted with this threat, several courses of action
present themselves. The masses can be bought off with some degree of
redistribution of resources, as the rich share out their wealth in the form of
social welfare programs, at least if resource constraints aren’t too binding.
But in addition to potentially reintroducing scarcity into the lives of the
rich, this solution is liable to lead to an ever-rising tide of demands on the
part of the masses, thus raising the specter of expropriation once again.</p><p>This is essentially what happened at the high tide of the welfare state,
in the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War II. For a while,
robust social benefits and strong labor unions coincided with high profits
and rapid growth, and so labor and capital enjoyed an uneasy peace. But
that very prosperity led to a situation where workers were empowered to
demand more and more power over the conditions of work, and so the
bosses began to fear that both profits and control over the workplace were
slipping out of their hands. In a capitalist society, this is an avoidable</p><p>tension: the boss needs the worker but is also terrified of his or her
potential power.</p><p>So what happens if the masses are dangerous but are no longer a
working class, and hence of no value to the rulers? Someone will
eventually get the idea that it would be better to get rid of them.</p><p>The Extermination Endgame</p><p>In 1980, the Marxist historian E. P. Thompson wrote an essay reflecting on
the Cold War and the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation, called
“Notes on Exterminism, the Last Stage of Civilization.”2 In it, he
contemplated the increasing turn of both the capitalist and communist
economies toward the technologies of militarism and war. It was, he
thought, inadequate to understand the arms race and the military buildup
as merely tools to defend the larger political economies of the contending
sides, be that the planned economy of the USSR or the capitalist market of
the United States. The military-industrial complex was taking up a larger
and larger part of the economy in the rich capitalist countries, and the
Soviets were likewise increasingly preoccupied with building up arms.</p><p>Thompson proposed that we needed a new category to understand this
social formation. He quotes Marx’s famous line from The Poverty of
Philosophy: “the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the
steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist.”3 That is, as the central
economic relations of a society change, all the social relations in that
society tend to change with them. Confronting the logic of military
industrialism, Thompson asks, “what are we given by those Satanic mills
which are now at work, grinding out the means of human extermination?”
His answer was that the category we needed was “exterminism.” This term
covers “these characteristics of a society—expressed, in differing degrees,
within its economy, its polity, and its ideology—which thrust it in a
direction whose outcome must be the extermination of multitudes.”4</p><p>The</p><p>largely
specific configuration Thompson discussed has
disappeared—there is no longer a Cold War or a USSR. Despite the best
efforts of militarist neoconservatives and others to nostalgically recreate
great power conflicts with Russia or China, these hardly compare to the
shadow of nuclear terror that hung over Thompson’s head. And so I have</p><p>repurposed his word to describe another order, the final of my four
hypothetical societies. Yet what I will describe is nevertheless another
kind of society that is “thrust … in a direction whose outcome must be the
extermination of multitudes.”</p><p>We still live in heavily militarized world, where the military budget
takes up almost as large a percentage of the US economy as it did when
Thompson wrote his essay. But the conflicts that define the era of the so-
called “War on Terror” are asymmetrical ones, pitting technologically
advanced militaries against weak states or stateless insurgents. The
lessons learned in these theaters come home, leading to the militarization
of domestic policing as well.</p><p>A world where the ruling class no longer depends on the exploitation
of working class labor is a world where the poor are merely a danger and
an inconvenience. Policing and repressing them ultimately seem more
trouble than can be justified. This is where the thrust toward “the
extermination of multitudes” originates. Its ultimate endpoint is literally
the extermination of the poor, so that the rabble can finally be brushed
aside once and for all, leaving the rich to live in peace and quiet in their
Elysium.</p><p>the problem of mass unemployment</p><p>In a 1983 article, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Wassily Leontief
that has been
anticipated
contemplated throughout this book. In what he calls, with some
understatement, a “somewhat shocking but essentially appropriate
analogy,” he compares workers to horses.</p><p>One might say that the process by which progressive introduction of new computerized,
automated, and robotized equipment can be expected to reduce the role of labor is similar
to the process by which the introduction of tractors and other machinery first reduced and
then completely eliminated horses and other draft animals in agriculture.5</p><p>As he then notes, this led most people to the conclusion that “from the
human point of view, keeping all these idle horses … would make little
sense.” As a result, the US horse population fell from 21.5 million in 1900
to 3 million in 1960.6 Leontief goes on to express, with the cheery
confidence of a mid-century technocrat, his confidence that since people
are not horses, we will surely find ways to support all of society’s
members. Echoing Gorz and other critics of wage labor, he argues that
“sooner or later … it will have to be admitted that the demand for</p><p>‘employment’ is in the first instance a demand for ‘livelihood,’ meaning
income.”7 However, given the contemptuous and cruel attitudes of today’s
ruling class, we can in no way take that for granted.</p><p>Fortunately, even the rich have developed norms of morality that make
it difficult to reach for this Final Solution as a first resort. Their initial
step is simply to hide from the poor, much like the characters in Elysium.
But all around us, we can see the gradual drift away from just corralling
and controlling “excess” populations, into justifications for permanently
eliminating them.</p><p>Enclave Societies and Social Control</p><p>The sociologist Bryan Turner has argued that we live in an “enclave
society.”8 Despite the myth of increasing mobility under globalization, we
in fact inhabit an order in which “governments and other agencies seek to
regulate spaces and, where necessary, to immobilize flows of people,
goods and services” by means of “enclosure, bureaucratic barriers, legal
exclusions and registrations.”9</p><p>Of course, it is the movements of the masses whose movements are
restricted, while the elite remains cosmopolitan and mobile. Some of the
examples Turner adduces are relatively trivial, like frequent-flyer lounges
and private rooms in public hospitals. Others are more serious, like gated
communities (or, in the more extreme case, private islands) for the rich,
and ghettos for the poor—where police are responsible for keeping poor
people out of the “wrong” neighborhoods. Biological quarantines and
immigration restrictions take the enclave concept to the level of the
nation-state. In all cases, the prison looms as the ultimate dystopian
enclave for those who do not comply, whether it is the federal penitentiary
or the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. Gated communities, private
islands, ghettos, prisons, terrorism paranoia, biological quarantines—these
amount to an inverted global gulag, where the rich live in tiny islands of
wealth strewn around an ocean of misery.</p><p>In Tropic of Chaos, Christian Parenti shows how this order is created in
the world’s crisis regions, as climate change brings about what he calls the
“catastrophic convergence” of ecological change, economic inequality, and
state failure.10 In the wake of colonialism and neoliberalism, the rich</p><p>countries, along with the elites of the poorer ones, have facilitated a
disintegration into anarchic violence, as various tribal and political
factions fight over the diminishing bounty of damaged ecosystems. Faced
with this bleak reality, many of the rich—which, in global terms, includes
many workers in the rich countries as well—have resigned themselves to
barricading themselves into their fortresses, to be protected by unmanned
drones and private military contractors. Guard labor, a feature of the
rentist society, reappears in an even more malevolent form, as a lucky few
are employed as enforcers and protectors for the rich.</p><p>But the construction of enclaves is not limited to the poorest places.
Across the world, the rich are demonstrating their desire to escape from
the rest of us. A 2013 article in Forbes magazine reports on the mania,
among the rich, for evermore-elaborate home security.11 An executive for
one security company boasts that his Los Angeles house has security
“similar to that of the White House.” Others market infrared sensors,
facial recognition technologies, and defensive systems that spray noxious
smoke or pepper spray. All this for people who, although rich, are largely
anonymous and hardly prominent targets for would-be attackers. Paranoid
though they may seem, large numbers of the economic elite appear to
regard themselves as a set-upon minority, at war with the rest of society.</p><p>Silicon Valley is a hotbed of such sentiments, plutocrats talking openly
about “secession.” In one widely disseminated speech, Balaji Srinivasan,
the cofounder of a San Francisco genetics company, told an audience of
start-up entrepreneurs that “we need to build opt-in society, outside the
US, run by technology.”12 For now, that reflects hubris and ignorance of
the myriad ways someone like him is supported by the workers who make
his life possible. But it demonstrates the impulse to wall off the rich from
what are deemed to be surplus populations.</p><p>Other trends are less dramatic than decamping to an opt-in society, but
nevertheless disturbing. Around the United States, residents of wealthier
neighborhoods are beginning to hire private security to defend themselves
from the perceived threat of their neighbors. In Oakland, small groups of
neighbors band together to hire their own guards, and one neighborhood
even took the initiative to raise $90,000 through a crowdfunding
campaign.13 Thus do the ranks of guard laborers swell.</p><p>And there are already those who would build an entire city to hide
from the masses. Off the coast of Lagos, Nigeria, a group of Lebanese
developers are building a private city, Eko Atlantic, intended to house
250,000. It is to be “a sustainable city, clean and energy efficient with
minimal carbon emissions.”14 It is also going to be a place where the elite
can escape from the millions of nearby Nigerians who live on less than a
dollar a day and scrounge in the informal economy. Another island, the
island of Manhattan, is also gradually being turned into an enclave of the
global rich: in 2014, over half of Manhattan real estate sales worth $5
million or more were to foreigners or anonymous buyers behind shell
companies (most of whom are believed to be non-American).15 These
purchases serve the dual purpose of laundering money and hiding it from
prying governments, as well as providing a landing place in case of unrest
in their home countries.</p><p>At the intersection of paranoia and tasteless consumption, there’s
Vivos, whose website promises “the ultimate life assurance solution for
high net worth families.” The company is building an eighty-apartment,
radiation-proof megabunker, carved into a mountain in Germany. These
aren’t your ordinary bomb-shelters, but rather luxury apartments featuring
all the leather and stainless steel trappings of the nouveau riche. Company
founder Robert Vicino described the complex to the Vice website as
comparable to “an underground yacht.” For a mere 2.5 million Euros and
up, you too can wait out the apocalypse in style. And Vivos is only one
example of what Forbes magazine called the “Billionaires’ Bunkers”
industry.16</p><p>From Enclave to Genocide</p><p>Today, we laugh at out-of-touch billionaires like venture capitalist Tom
Perkins, who in 2014 compared criticism of the rich to Kristallnacht, the
attacks on Jews in Nazi Germany in 1938.17 Or Cartier jewelry executive
Johann Rupert, who told a 2015 Financial Times conference that the
prospect of an insurgency among the poor is “what keeps me awake at
night.”18 But while such views are repugnant, they are not without logic.
In a world of hyperinequality and mass unemployment, you can try to buy
off the masses for a while, and then you can try to repress them by force.</p><p>But so long as immiserated hordes exist, there is the danger that one day it
may become impossible to hold them at bay. When mass labor has been
rendered superfluous, a final solution lurks: the genocidal war of the rich
against the poor. The specter of automation rises once again, but in a very
different way. Under rentism, it merely tended to make more and more
workers superfluous,
toward
underemployment and weak demand. An exterminist society can automate
and mechanize the process of suppression and extermination, allowing the
rulers and their minions to distance themselves from the consequences of
their actions.</p><p>the system’s</p><p>intensifying</p><p>tendency</p><p>But is that final move, from repression to outright extermination,
really plausible? Such slippages begin first where a class conflict is
overlaid with a national one, as in the Israeli occupation of Palestine. At
one time, Israel heavily depended on cheap Palestinian labor. But as
political economist Adam Hanieh has demonstrated, since the late 1990s
these workers have been displaced by migrant laborers from Asia and
Eastern Europe.19 Having thus rendered Palestinians superfluous as
workers, Israel is able to give free reign to the more fanatical aspects of
Zionism’s settler-colonial project. In its 2014 assault on the Gaza Strip,
the government made claims of “self-defense” that were almost laughably
perfunctory, even as they bombed hospitals, schools, and power plants,
indiscriminately killing men, women, and children alike and leveling
much of the housing stock. Open calls for genocide came from members
of the Israeli parliament; one, Ayelet Shaked, proclaimed that “the entire
Palestinian people is the enemy.” On this basis she justified the destruction
of Gaza as a whole, “including its elderly and its women, its cities and its
villages, its property and its infrastructure.”20</p><p>Americans might think themselves immune to such barbarity, despite
the political class’s almost uniform support for Israel’s war on Gaza. But
Nobel Peace Prize–winning President Barack Obama already claims the
right to kill American citizens without the pretense of due process. His
government even uses algorithmic methods to identify targets without
necessarily knowing their identities.</p><p>In 2012, the Washington Post published a story about something called
the “disposition matrix.”21 This was the Obama administration’s “next-
generation targeting list,” a sort of spreadsheet of doom used to keep track</p><p>of all those foreigners marked for anonymous drone assassination as
alleged terrorists. The story was full of chilling comments from officials.
One of them remarks that a killer drone is “like your lawn mower”: no
matter how many terrorists you kill, “the grass is going to grow back.” To
streamline the process of indefinite killing, then, the process is partially
automated. The Post reports on the development of algorithms for so-
called “‘signature strikes,’ which allow the CIA and [Joint Special
Operations Command] to hit targets based on patterns of activity … even
when the identities of those who would be killed is unclear.”22</p><p>Such actions are supported by a substantial number of Americans.
Sadly, this indifference to the deaths of those seen as foreigners or others
has long characterized the response to US warmaking. But the exterminist
mindset has its echoes domestically as well. In the United States, the
willingness to countenance the elimination of unruly surplus populations
is tightly intertwined with racism, though it is unquestionably a class
phenomenon as well. This can be seen in a prison system that now
incarcerates 2 million people, many for nonviolent drug offenses. And it
often does so in conditions that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy
called “incompatible with the concept of human dignity,” with “no place in
civilized society,” in his opinion on overcrowding in the California prison
system.23</p><p>The American prison system has long been a way to control the
unemployed who get locked away inside while buying off those who
remain on the outside. In her analysis of the California prison system,
Ruth Wilson Gilmore describes the massive growth of incarceration as the
construction of a “golden gulag.”24 Urban youth who lack social services
and jobs are ruthlessly targeted by police, locked up for long terms under
draconian drug laws and California’s “three strikes” provision. The
resulting explosion in prison construction, meanwhile, provides jobs in
rural areas of the state with depressed economies. With agricultural work
automated or shifted to ultra-low-wage migrant labor, and manufacturing
jobs lost to deindustrialization, prison work has become among the last
remaining well-paid labor in these places.</p><p>Prison sentencing can even be offloaded onto algorithms, the better to
allow administrators to deny their active role in constructing these
warehouses of misery. At least twenty US states now use so-called</p><p>“evidence-based sentencing.” The name sounds innocuous—who could
oppose the use of evidence? Richard Redding, a University of Virginia law
professor and advocate of the method, goes so far as to claim that it “may
even be unethical” to use sentencing techniques that are not “transparent”
and “entirely rational.”25 But the factors that can go into an evidence-
based sentence, by Redding’s own account, include not just crimes a
person has committed, but those they might commit in the future—the
“risk factors” and “criminogenic needs” that “increase the likelihood of
recidivism.” At this point these models of “future crime risk” start to
come uncomfortably close to the dystopia of the Philip K. Dick story (and
later Tom Cruise movie) The Minority Report, in which a “Precrime”
division arrests people for crimes they have not yet committed.</p><p>Today even some on the right are questioning mass incarceration,
sometimes simply on budgetary grounds. But barring any effort to actually
provide for either prisoners or the workers who benefit from the prison
boom, what is to become of all these surplus populations? Sometimes,
those who make it to prison are the lucky ones. Steeped in a culture that is
quick to resort to violence, police forces routinely maim and kill those
suspected of minor crimes or no crime at all. The brutality of the police is
not new, but two things have changed: they have become more militarized
and more heavily armed, while the Internet and the ubiquity of video
recording equipment has made documentation of their behavior easier.</p><p>Radley Balko has described the militarization of the police as the
emergence of the “warrior cop.”26 Police increasingly dress in military
style and think in military terms. SWAT teams, heavily armed paramilitary
units that were originally promoted as a response to high-level threats, are
now deployed as a matter of routine. A few hundred SWAT raids per year
were conducted across the United States in the 1970s; now there are 100 to
150 every day. Often these raids are responding to minor crimes like
marijuana possession or gambling. And they can be performed without a
warrant, under the guise of being “administrative searches” such as license
inspections. A few videos of these raids can be found on the Internet, and
they convey the surreal horror of a heavily armed battalion storming
someone’s house over a few ounces of pot.</p><p>The result is a steady stream of dead and injured suspects and their
family members—or nonsuspects, in the frequent scenario where the
SWAT team invades the wrong house, as Balko documents at great length.</p><p>He cites raids like the one in 2003, when fifty-seven-year-old government
employee Alberta Spruill died of a heart attack after the New York Police
Department threw a “flash-bang” grenade into what they thought was the
apartment of a drug dealer, based only on an anonymous tip.</p><p>Even when they have the right address, militarized police responses
can cause chaos and destruction that even the people who called the police
in the first place never intended. The 2015 documentary Peace Officer
tells the story of Dub Lawrence, a former Utah county sheriff who became
a police critic after his son-in-law was shot by a SWAT team officer during
a standoff that was originally precipitated by a domestic violence call
from his girlfriend.27</p><p>At the street level, too, the threat of police violence is constant,
especially for the black and brown. In July 2014, New York City resident
Eric Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by officers, for the
suspected crime of selling untaxed loose cigarettes. His death provoked an
uproar in part because the incident was caught on a cell phone camera, but
also because it brought attention to something that is all too routine. Soon
after, Mike Brown was shot down in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri,
giving more fuel to a national movement. Although exact details of the
encounter are disputed, all agree that Brown was unarmed and that the
officer who shot him started a confrontation over the grave crime of
walking in the street. These events echoed many similar incidents around
the country, an unceasing drumbeat of violence over the years. In Oakland,
for example, there was the police execution of Oscar Grant. After being
detained by a transit officer in connection with reports of fighting on a
BART train, a bystander’s cell phone video showed the officer shouting
racial epithets at Grant and then shooting him while he was restrained and
face down on the platform. This touched off a protest movement that was
an important precursor to Occupy Oakland.</p><p>Recent police militarization has its roots in the social upheavals of the
1960s, when the state sought to repress the black freedom and anti-war
movements. And the transformation of the police into something akin to
an occupying army is inseparable from the history of American
imperialism and warmaking abroad, because it is both a literal and
figurative case of bringing the war home. Historian Julilly Kohler-
Hausmann describes the intersection of these struggles with Vietnam
itself, with the imagery of “urban jungles” contributing to “widespread</p><p>social acceptance of the idea that urban police were engaged in warlike
sieges in poor communities.”28 The process of militarization has
accelerated in the era of the “war on terror,” as not just imagery but
weapons flow from the battlefield to the homefront.</p><p>More than a diffuse cultural shift, militarized policing should be
understood as a conscious state strategy, with the federal government
using anti-terrorism as a pretext to make local police more like soldiers.
Many police officers are themselves veterans, hardened to civilian deaths
by their experiences in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. The US
government encourages the transition of soldiers into law enforcement
agents through its Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)
program, by prioritizing grants to agencies that hire veterans. Meanwhile,
the technology they use—the massive armored fighting vehicles that now
grace the streets of even small towns—are repurposed military equipment.
The US Department of Homeland Security hands out “anti-terrorism”
grants with which police departments large and small can purchase such
equipment. Other agencies can acquire similar gear for free, by
participating in the Department of Defense’s 1033 program, which
distributes surplus military equipment freed up by troop withdrawals in
Iraq and Afghanistan.29</p><p>The result is absurdities like the delivery of a Mine- Resistant Ambush
Protected (MRAP) vehicle to High Springs, Florida, population 5,350.30
These heavily armored, tanklike vehicles were originally used to protect
soldiers from the explosives of Iraqi and Afghan insurgents, who are
generally thought to be uncommon in central Florida. Perhaps it is
unsurprising, then—or perhaps it is a rare example of police sanity—that
the police chief of High Springs reported that he had not used the MRAP
in the year since receiving it and was hoping to transfer it to another
agency. But other departments are happy to roll out the tanks and body
armor, as we saw in the images from Ferguson. In a remarkably short
time, we’ve become used to these images, which recall Paul Verhoeven’s
1987 movie Robocop, a movie that, at the time, was intended as an
absurdly over-the-top dystopian depiction of a militarized near-future
Detroit.</p><p>The warrior cop is not merely a danger to individual train riders and
cigarette hawkers, illegal gamblers or occasional pot smokers. Their fate</p><p>is tied to the fate of political mobilization, as can be seen in the United
States and around the world. Mass protest everywhere is already violently
repressed, and not just in states like Egypt or China that are popularly
regarded as authoritarian. A 2013 report from the International Network of
Civil Liberties Organizations documents the widespread “use of lethal and
deadly force in response to largely peaceful gatherings seeking to express
social and political viewpoints,” in places ranging from Canada to Egypt
to Kenya to South Africa to the United States.31 The crackdown on the
Occupy movement was one example of this, a show of force by squads of
armored cops in cities across the country. Meanwhile the surveillance-
state
former National Security Agency
whistleblower Edward Snowden and others show just how powerful are the
state’s tools for repressing dissent and monitoring the activities of
activists.</p><p>revealed by</p><p>techniques</p><p>In this context, it becomes easier to envision the slippage from
inhuman prisons, violent police crackdowns, and occasional summary
executions
to more systematic forms of elimination. Algorithmic
targeting, combined with the increasing power of unmanned combat
drones, promises to ease the moral discomfort of mass killing, by
distancing those who mobilize violence from their targets. Operators can
sit safely in remote silos, piloting their death robots in far-off places. It
approaches the world of Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game. In that story, a
child is recruited to train for a war with a race of aliens. As part of his
final training, he participates in a simulation in which he destroys the
entire homeworld. It was of course not a simulation; young Ender has
actually finished the war by committing genocide. Things in our world
may not play out with such literal deceptions, but we can already see how
our political and economic elites manage to justify ever-higher levels of
misery and death while remaining convinced that they are great
humanitarians.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>Introduction: Technology and Ecology as Apocalypse and Utopia</p><p>1 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “Trends in Atmospheric Carbon</p><p>Dioxide,” ESRL.NOAA.gov, 2014.</p><p>2 Thomas F.

TRANSITIONS AND PROSPECTS</p><p>This work is not, I have emphasized, an exercise in futurism; I don’t aim
to predict the precise course of social development. Not only do such
predictions have a terrible performance record, they produce an aura of
inevitability that encourages us to sit back and passively accept our
destiny. The reason there are four futures, and not just one, is because
nothing happens automatically. It’s up to us to determine the way forward.
Climate justice activists are currently fighting for socialist rather than
exterminist solutions to climate change, even if they wouldn’t put it that
way. And those who are fighting for access to knowledge, against strict
intellectual property in everything from seeds to music, are struggling to
hold off a rentist dystopia and keep the dream of communism alive. To
cover those movements in the detail they deserve would require volumes
of their own. So rather than attempt an impossible summary, I’ll close
with some thoughts about the complexities that arise when we think about
the four futures not just as ideals or self-contained utopias, but as the
objects of dynamic and ongoing political projects.</p><p>For anyone of a left-wing, egalitarian bent, it’s easy to say that rentism
and exterminism represent the side of evil, and socialism and communism,
the hopes of the good. That might be adequate if we conceive of those
ideal societies only as destinations or as slogans to put on our banners. But
none of these model societies are meant to represent something that could
be implemented overnight, in a complete transformation of current social
relations. Indeed, probably none of them is possible at all in a pure form;</p><p>history is simply too messy for that, and real societies exceed the
parameters of any theoretical model.</p><p>Which means that we should be particularly concerned with the road
leading toward these utopias and dystopias, rather than the precise nature
of the final destination. Especially because the path that leads to utopia is
not necessarily itself utopian.</p><p>In Chapter 1, I suggested a particularly fanciful and utopian way to a
utopian destination: the “capitalist road to communism” in which the
universal basic income lubricates the slide into full communism. But that
transition would entail dethroning the ultrarich elite that currently
dominates our politics and economics alike. The limited historical
experience with actual basic income programs suggests that the rich are
unlikely to stand by while their wealth and power wither away, and so
there will be difficult struggles.</p><p>Consider, for example, the pilot project that was run in 2008 and 2009
in Otjivero-Omitara, Namibia. For two years, everyone in the village
received a monthly payment of one hundred Namibia dollars (about
US$13). In human terms, even such a minimal basic income was a great
success: school attendance soared, child malnourishment plummeted, and
even crime declined. But that was of little concern to the white farmers
who made up the local elite. They insisted, against all evidence, that the
basic income had led to crime and alcoholism. Dirk Haarmann, an
economist and theologian who helped implement the basic income project,
speculates that they were “afraid that the poor will gain some influence
and deprive the rich, white 20 percent of the population of some of their
power.”1 And perhaps, more immediately, they were concerned that $100 a
month will make workers less eager to accept the $2-per-hour minimum
wage for farm labor.</p><p>The transition to a world of abundance and equality, then, is likely to
be a tumultuous and conflict-ridden one. If the rich won’t relinquish their
privileges voluntarily, they would have to be expropriated by force, and
such struggles can have dire consequences for both sides. For as Friedrich
Nietzsche said in a famous aphorism, “Beware that, when fighting
monsters, you yourself do not become a monster … for when you gaze
long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”2 Or as the Communist</p><p>poet Bertolt Brecht wrote in “To Posterity,” a revolution against a brutal
system could itself brutalize those who participated in it.</p><p>Even anger against injustice
Makes the voice grow harsh. Alas, we
Who wished to lay the foundations of kindness
Could not ourselves be kind.3</p><p>Or as Mao put it in his characteristic blunt style, “a revolution is not a
dinner party.”4 In other words, even the most successful and justified
revolution has losers and victims.</p><p>In a 1962 letter to the economist Paul Baran, the critical theorist
Herbert Marcuse remarks that “nobody ever gave a damn about the
victims of history.”5 The remark was directed at the hypocrisy of liberals
who were eager to moralize about the victims of Soviet Communism but
were silent about the massive human cost of capitalism. It’s a harsh,
perhaps a cruel judgment, and Marcuse himself suggests the need to move
beyond it. But it provides an important perspective on the exercise I’ve
undertaken here, by allowing us to see that society’s four futures don’t fit
into neat moral boxes.</p><p>That is one danger, that we underestimate the difficulty of the path we
must traverse, or that we allow the beauty of our endpoint to license
unlimited brutality along the way. But another possibility is that, at
journey’s end, we forget how arduous the journey was and who we left
behind. Walter Benjamin, in his essay “On the Concept of History,” talks
about the way that historical accounts necessarily tend to empathize with
the victors, who are generally the ones who get to write the history. “Those
who currently rule are however the heirs of all those who have ever been
victorious. Empathy with the victors thus comes to benefit the current
rulers every time.”6 But we can also say that even in a society without
clear rulers, history will tend to empathize with the survivors; they are,
after all, literally the only ones around to write it. Let’s revisit, on that
note, the residents of our first, communist future. Perhaps they’re not at
the end of the capitalist road to communism after all, but of a much longer
and darker journey through the horrors of exterminism.</p><p>Remember exterminism’s central problematic: abundance and freedom
from work are possible for a minority, but material limits make it
impossible to extend that same way of life to everyone. At the same time,</p><p>automation has rendered masses of workers superfluous. The result is a
society of surveillance, repression, and incarceration, always threatening
to tip over into one of outright genocide.</p><p>But suppose we stare into that abyss? What’s left when the “excess”
bodies have been disposed of and the rich are finally left alone with their
robots and their walled compounds? The combat drones and robot
executioners could be decommissioned, the apparatus of surveillance
gradually dismantled, and the remaining population could evolve past its
brutal and dehumanizing war morality and settle into a life of equality and
abundance—in other words, into communism.</p><p>As a descendant of Europeans in the United States, I have an idea of</p><p>what that might be like. After all, I’m the beneficiary of a genocide.</p><p>inhabitants. Today,</p><p>My society was founded on the systematic extermination of the North
American continent’s original
surviving
descendants of those earliest Americans are sufficiently impoverished,
small in number, and geographically isolated that most Americans can
easily ignore them as they go about their lives. Occasionally the survivors
force themselves onto our attention. But mostly, while we may lament the
brutality of our ancestors, we don’t contemplate giving up our prosperous
lives or our land. Just as Marcuse said, nobody ever gave a damn about the
victims of history.</p><p>the</p><p>Zooming out a bit farther, then, the point is that we don’t necessarily
pick one of the four futures: we could get them all, and there are paths that
lead from each one to all of the others.</p><p>We have seen how exterminism becomes communism. Communism, in
turn, is always subject to counterrevolution, if someone can find a way to
reintroduce artificial scarcity and create a new rentist elite. Socialism is
subject to this pressure even more severely, since the greater level of
shared material hardship increases the impetus for some group to set itself
up as the privileged elite and turn the system into an exterminist one.</p><p>But short of a civilizational collapse so complete that it cuts us off
from our accumulated knowledge and plunges us into a new dark ages, it’s
hard to see a road that leads back to industrial capitalism as we have
known it. That is the other important point of this book. We can’t go back
to the past, and we can’t even hold on to what we have now. Something
new is coming—and indeed, in some way, all four futures are already here,</p><p>“unevenly distributed,” in William Gibson’s phrase. It’s up to us to build
the collective power to fight for the futures we want.</p><hr><p><a href=/>Back to Library</a></p></article></main></body></html>

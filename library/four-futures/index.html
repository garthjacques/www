The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts diminishing sea ice, acidification of the oceans, and increasing frequency of droughts and extreme storm events.[^2]</p><p>At the same time, news of technological breakthroughs in the context of high unemployment and stagnant wages has produced anxious warnings about the effects of automation on the future of work. In early 2014, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee published <em>The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies</em>.[^3] They surveyed a future in which computer and robotics technology replaces human labor not just in traditional domains such as agriculture and manufacturing, but also in sectors ranging from medicine and law to transportation. At Oxford University, a research unit released a widely publicized report estimating that nearly half the jobs in the United States today are vulnerable to computerization.[^4]</p><p>These twin anxieties are in many ways diametrical opposites. The fear of climate change is a fear of having too little: it anticipates a scarcity of natural resources, the loss of agricultural land and habitable environments—and ultimately the demise of an Earth that can support human life. The fear of automation is, perversely, a fear of too much: a fully robotized economy that produces so much, with so little human labor, that there is no longer any need for workers. Can we really be facing a crisis of scarcity and a crisis of abundance at the same time?</p><p>The argument of this book is that we are in fact facing such a contradictory dual crisis. And it is the interaction of these two dynamics that makes our historical moment so volatile and uncertain, full of both promise and danger. In the chapters that follow, I will attempt to sketch some of the possible interactions between these two dynamics.</p><p>First, however, I need to lay out the contours of current debates over automation and climate change.</p><h3 id=rise-of-the-robots>Rise of the Robots</h3><p>&ldquo;Welcome Robot Overlords,&rdquo; reads a feature headline published in 2013 by <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine, &ldquo;Please Don&rsquo;t Fire Us?&rdquo;[^5] The article, by liberal pundit Kevin Drum, exemplifies a raft of coverage in recent years, surveying the rapid spread of automation and computerization throughout every part of the economy. These stories tend to veer between wonder and dread at the possibilities of all this new gadgetry. In stories like Drum&rsquo;s, rapid progress in automation heralds the possibility of a world with a better quality of life and more leisure time for all; but alternatively, it heralds mass unemployment and the continued enrichment of the 1 percent.</p><p>This is not a new tension by any means. The folk tale of John Henry and the steam hammer, which originated in the nineteenth century, describes a railroad worker who tries to race against a steel powered drill and wins—only to drop dead from the effort. But several factors have come together to accentuate worries about technology and its effect on labor. The persistently weak post-recession labor market has produced a generalized background anxiety about job loss. Automation and computerization are beginning to reach into professional and creative industries that long seemed immune, threatening the jobs of the very journalists who cover these issues. And the pace of change at least seems, to many, to be faster than ever.</p><p>The &ldquo;second machine age&rdquo; is a concept promoted by Brynjolfsson and McAfee. In their book of the same name, they argue that just as the first machine age—the Industrial Revolution—replaced human muscle with machine power, computerization is allowing us to greatly magnify, or even replace, &ldquo;the ability to use our brains to understand and shape our environments.&rdquo;[^6] In that book and its predecessor, <em>Race Against the Machine</em>, Brynjolfsson and McAfee argue that computers and robots are rapidly permeating every part of the economy, displacing labor from high- and low-skill functions alike. Central to their view is the processing of much of the world into digital information, with everything from books and music to street networks now available in a form that can be copied and transmitted around the world instantly and nearly for free.</p><p>The applications that this kind of data enables are enormously varied, especially in combination with advances in physical-world robotics and sensing. In a widely cited study using a detailed analysis of different occupations produced by the US Department of Labor, Oxford University researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne speculated that 47 percent of current US employment is susceptible to computerization thanks to current technological developments.[^7] Stuart Elliott at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development uses the same source data but a different approach over a longer time frame and suggested that the figure could be as high as 80 percent. These figures are the result of both subjective classifying decisions and complex quantitative methodology, so it would be a mistake to put too much faith in any exact number. Nevertheless, it should be clear that the possibility of rapid further automation in the near future is very real.</p><p>Brynjolfsson and McAfee are perhaps the best-known prophets of rapid automation, but their work fits into an exploding genre. Software entrepreneur Martin Ford, for example, explores similar terrain in his 2015 work <em>Rise of the Robots</em>.[^8] He relies on much of the same literature and reaches many of the same conclusions about the pace of automation. His conclusions are somewhat more radical—a guaranteed universal basic income, which will be discussed later in this book, occupies a place of prominence; much of the rival literature, by contrast, offers little more than bromides about education.</p><p>That many people are writing about rapid and socially dislocating automation doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s an imminent reality. As I noted above, anxiety about labor-saving technology is actually a constant through the whole history of capitalism. But we do see many indications that we now have the possibility—although not necessarily the reality—of drastically reducing the need for human labor. A few examples will demonstrate the diverse areas in which human labor is being reduced or eliminated entirely.</p><p>In 2011, IBM made headlines with its Watson supercomputer, which successfully competed and won against human competitors on the game show <em>Jeopardy</em>. Although this feat was a somewhat frivolous publicity stunt, it also demonstrated Watson&rsquo;s suitability for other, more valuable tasks. The technology is already being tested to assist doctors in processing the enormous volume of medical literature to better diagnose patients, which in fact was the system&rsquo;s original purpose. But it is also being released as the &ldquo;Watson Engagement Advisor,&rdquo; which is intended for customer service and technical support applications. By responding to free-form natural language queries from users, this software could potentially replace the call center workers (many in places like India) who currently perform this work. The review of legal documents, an extremely time-consuming process traditionally performed by legions of junior lawyers, is another promising application of the technology.</p><p>Another area of rapid advance is robotics, the interaction of machinery with the physical world. Over the twentieth century, great advances were made in the development of large-scale industrial robots, of the sort that could operate a car assembly line. But only recently have they begun to challenge the areas in which humans excel: fine-grained motor skills and the navigation of a complex physical terrain. The US Department of Defense is now developing computer-controlled sewing machines so as to avoid sourcing its uniforms from China.[^9] Until just the past few years, self-driving cars were regarded as well beyond the scope of our technical ability. Now the combination of sensor technology and comprehensive map databases is making it a reality in such projects as the Google self-driving fleet. Meanwhile a company called Locus Robotics has launched a robot that can process orders in giant warehouses, potentially replacing the workers for Amazon and other companies who currently toil in often brutal conditions.[^10]</p><p>Automation continues to proceed even in agriculture, which once consumed the largest share of human labor but now makes up a tiny fraction of employment, especially in the United States and other rich countries. In California, changing Mexican economic conditions and border crackdowns have led to labor shortages. This has spurred farmers to invest in new machinery that can take on even delicate tasks like fruit harvesting, which have until now required the precision of a human hand.[^11] This development illustrates a recurrent capitalist dynamic: as workers become more powerful and better paid, the pressure on capitalists to automate increases. When there is a huge pool of low wage migrant farm labor, a $100,000 fruit picker looks like a wasteful indulgence. But when workers are scarce and can command better wages, the incentive to replace them with machinery is intensified.</p><p>The trend toward automation runs through the entire history of capitalism. In recent years it was muted and somewhat disguised, because of the enormous injection of cheap labor that global capitalism received after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the turn toward capitalism in China. But now even Chinese companies are facing labor shortages and looking to new ways of automating and robotizing.</p><p>Innumerable further examples can be produced. Robot anesthesiologists to replace physicians. A hamburger-making machine that can replace the staff of a McDonald&rsquo;s. Large-scale 3-D printers that can turn out entire houses within a day. Each week brings strange new things.</p><p>Automation is liable to move beyond even this, into the oldest and most fundamental form of women&rsquo;s labor. In the 1970s, the radical feminist theorist Shulamith Firestone called for growing babies in artificial wombs, as a way to liberate women from their dominated position in the relations of reproduction.[^12] Fanciful at the time, such technologies are becoming a reality today. Japanese scientists have successfully birthed goats from artificial wombs and grown human embryos for up to ten days. Further work on applying this technology to human babies is now as much restricted by law as science; Japan prohibits growing human embryos artificially for longer than fourteen days.[^13] Many women find such a prospect off-putting and welcome the experience of carrying a child. But surely many others would prefer to be liberated from the obligation.</p><p>Most of this book will take for granted the premise of the automation optimists, that within as little as a few decades we could live in a Star Trek-like world where, as Kevin Drum put it in <em>Mother Jones</em>, &ldquo;robots can do everything humans can do, and they do it uncomplainingly, 24 hours a day,&rdquo; and &ldquo;scarcity of ordinary consumer goods is a thing of the past.&rdquo;[^14] Such claims are likely to be hyperbole, which for the purposes of this book is fine: my approach is deliberately hyperbolic, sketching out simplified ideal types to illustrate fundamental principles. It&rsquo;s not important that absolutely everything will be done by robots, only that a large amount of the labor currently done by humans is in the process of being automated away.</p><p>But there remains much controversy over just how fast automation can proceed and what processes will be susceptible to it. So before delving into the possible social consequences of that process, I will sketch out some of the recent, rapid developments in the so-called &ldquo;second machine age&rdquo; we live in. This is a sequel to—or, as some see it, merely an extension of—the first machine age of large-scale industrial automation.</p><h3 id=fear-of-a-mechanical-planet>Fear of a Mechanical Planet</h3><p>Objections to the predictions and fears of wide-ranging automation fall into three broad categories. Some argue that reports of new technology are overhyped and overblown and that we are a long way from truly being able to replace human labor in most fields. Others, following a traditional argument from mainstream economics, contend that past episodes of rapid productivity growth have simply opened up new kinds of work and new jobs, not led to massive unemployment, and that this time will be no different. Finally, some on the Left see an obsessive focus on futuristic automation scenarios as a distraction from more pressing political tasks such as government investment and stimulus and improved wages and conditions in the workplace.</p><h4 id=reports-of-labors-demise-greatly-exaggerated>Reports of Labor&rsquo;s Demise: Greatly Exaggerated?</h4><p>Those who believe that technology is given exaggerated significance usually point to the published statistics on productivity growth. A large-scale adoption of robots and machinery ought to show up as a rapid increase in the statistics that measure the productivity of labor—that is, the amount of output that can be generated per worker. But in fact, the rate of productivity growth in recent years has been relatively low. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that from 2007 to 2014, the annual rate of change was only 1.4 percent. That&rsquo;s a pace lower than at any time since the 1970s and half what was seen during the postwar boom years.</p><p>This leads some to argue that the anecdotal accounts of great breakthroughs in robotics and computation are misleading, because they aren&rsquo;t actually being translated into economic results. The economists Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon are most closely associated with this view.[^15] Doug Henwood, of the Left Business Observer, makes a similar case from the Left.[^16]</p><p>For more conservative economists like Cowen and Gordon, the problem is largely technical. The new technologies aren&rsquo;t really all that great, at least from an economic perspective, compared to breakthroughs like electricity or the internal combustion engine. We&rsquo;ve picked the &ldquo;low-hanging fruit,&rdquo; in Cowen&rsquo;s terms, and unless we find some more we&rsquo;re doomed to slow growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Left critics, like Henwood and Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, locate our problems not in technology, but in policy. For them, blaming the weak economic recovery after the 2008 recession on automation is a distraction from the real issue, which is that government policy has not been sufficiently focused on fiscal stimulus and job creation, thus preventing the economy from reaching full employment. Worries about robots are, from this point of view, both counter-factual (because productivity growth is low) and politically reactionary.</p><p>But others, including Brynjolfsson and McAfee, argue that even if no great fundamental breakthroughs are on the horizon, there is much to be gained from refining and recombining the breakthroughs we have already seen. This is a common historical pattern; many new techniques that were discovered during the Great Depression, for example, weren&rsquo;t economically fully exploited until the postwar boom. Moreover, even those changes that don&rsquo;t get reflected numerically in the Gross Domestic Product can still contribute to our social wealth—like the huge volume of information available freely and rapidly on the Internet, which has greatly increased my efficiency in writing this book.</p><p>To leftist critics of the automation narrative, we can offer a more complex answer: their analysis is narrowly correct but doesn&rsquo;t look far enough ahead. This is because the recent trends in productivity can also be read as reflections of a curious tension between the economy&rsquo;s short-term equilibrium and its long-term potential.</p><p>The first two recessions of the twenty-first century led to weak recoveries, characterized by stagnant wages and high unemployment. In that context, the existence of a large pool of unemployed and low-wage workers operates as a disincentive for employers to automate. After all, why replace a worker with a robot, if the worker is cheaper? But a corollary to this principle is that, if wages begin to rise and labor markets tighten, employers will start to turn to the new technologies that are currently being developed, rather than pay the cost of additional labor. As I argue in the following sections, the real impediments to tight labor markets are currently political, not technological.</p><h4 id=automations-eternal-return>Automation&rsquo;s Eternal Return</h4><p>Mainstream economists have for generations made the same argument about the supposed danger that automation poses to labor. If some jobs are automated, they argue, labor is freed up for other, new, and perhaps better kinds of work. They point to agriculture, which once occupied most of the workforce but now occupies only about 2 percent of it in a country like the United States. The decline of agricultural employment freed up workers who would go into the factories and make up the great industrial manufacturing economy of the mid-twentieth century. And the subsequent automation and offshoring of manufacturing, in turn, led to the boom in the service sector.</p><p>Why, then, should today be any different? If a robot takes your job, something else will surely be on the horizon. Supporters of this position can point to previous waves of anxiety about automation, such as the one in the 1990s that produced works like Jeremy Rifkin&rsquo;s <em>The End of Work</em> and Stanley Aronowitz and Bill DeFazio&rsquo;s <em>The Jobless Future</em>.[^17] As early as 1948, the mathematician and cyberneticist Norbert Wiener warned in his book <em>Cybernetics</em> that in the &ldquo;second, cybernetic industrial revolution,&rdquo; we were approaching a society in which &ldquo;the average human being of mediocre attainments or less has nothing to sell that it is worth anyone&rsquo;s money to buy.&rdquo;[^18] While many jobs have indeed been lost to automation, and jobless rates have risen and fallen with the business cycle, the social crisis of extreme mass unemployment, which many of these authors anticipated, has failed to arrive.</p><p>Of course, this is the kind of argument that can only be made from a great academic height, while ignoring the pain and disruption caused to actual workers who are displaced, whether or not they can eventually find new work. And even some in the mainstream suspect that, perhaps, this time really is different. Nobel Prize–winner and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is perhaps the most prominent person to give voice to these doubts.[^19] But the deeper problem with the traditional analysis is that it poses the process as a scientific inevitability when it is actually a social and political choice.</p><p>Today, most labor struggles turn on increasing wages and benefits or improving working conditions. But until the time of the Great Depression in the 1930s, socialist and labor movements struggled for, and won, progressive reductions in the length of the working day as well. In the nineteenth century, the ten-hour-day movement gave way to the eight-hour-day movement. Even in the 1930s, the American Federation of Labor supported a law to reduce the work week to thirty hours. But after World War II, for a variety of reasons, work reduction gradually disappeared from labor&rsquo;s agenda. The forty-hour (or more) week was taken for granted, and the question became merely how well it would be compensated.</p><p>This would have surprised the economist John Maynard Keynes, who speculated in the 1930s that people in our time would work as little as fifteen hours per week. That would mean working less than a third of the forty-hour work week that is still widely considered to be the standard. And yet productivity since Keynes&rsquo;s time has more than tripled, so it would have been possible to take that growth in the form of free time for the masses. This didn&rsquo;t happen, not because it isn&rsquo;t technically possible, but because of the outcomes of the political choices and social struggles of the twentieth century.</p><p>Some will argue that keeping our high working hours was worth it, because it made possible all the trappings of our modern world that Keynes could never have imagined, such as smartphones, flat-screen televisions, and the Internet. Because when most people think about working shorter hours, they think that they will have to give up some of the trappings of our advanced capitalist society, things that they enjoy, like their smartphones and their televisions.</p><p>That might be true to some extent, depending on the degree of work reduction we&rsquo;re talking about. But reducing work time can also reduce the cost of living, because it gives us time to do things that we would otherwise have to pay someone else to do, and it reduces costs like commuting that we have to pay just in order to work. And beyond that, our current society is filled with work that doesn&rsquo;t add anything to human flourishing and exists only to enrich someone else&rsquo;s bottom line—things like the collection of student loans (which would not exist if education were free) and many big-bank positions that facilitate dangerous and destabilizing speculation.</p><p>In any case, if we were to decide to make work reduction a social priority, we could gradually reduce hours in line with increases in productivity, so that people could gradually work less and less, while enjoying the same standard of living. And while some might prefer to keep working more in order to accumulate more and more stuff, probably many others would not. Even if we can never reach the pure post-work utopia, we can certainly move closer to it. Decreasing the work week from forty hours to thirty would move us in that direction. So would something like a universal basic income, which guarantees a minimum payment to every citizen regardless of work or any of the other strings that are attached to traditional welfare plans.</p><h4 id=technophilia-as-a-technology-of-distraction>Technophilia as a Technology of Distraction</h4><p>Even supposing that, in the long run, the political questions and possibilities raised by automation are real, a good argument can be made that we face more significant short-term challenges. As noted above, productivity growth, which gives an indication of the number of workers actually needed to run the economy, has in fact been quite weak in recent years. Moreover, the lack of job growth after recent economic recessions can plausibly be attributed not to robots, but to failures of government policy.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because in the short run, the lack of jobs can be attributed not to automation, but to a lack of what is known, in the economists&rsquo; jargon, as aggregate demand. In other words, the reason employers don&rsquo;t hire more workers is because there aren&rsquo;t enough people buying their products, and the reason people aren&rsquo;t buying their products is because they don&rsquo;t have enough money—either because they don&rsquo;t have jobs or because their wages are too low.</p><p>The solution to this situation, according to traditional Keynesian economic theories, is for the government to increase demand by a combination of monetary policy (lowering interest rates), fiscal policy (government investment in job creation, for instance through building infrastructure), and regulation (such as a higher minimum wage). And while governments did lower interest rates after the Great Recession, they did not do so in combination with sufficient investment in job creation, leading to a &ldquo;jobless recovery&rdquo; in which output—that is, the quantity of goods and services produced—slowly began to grow again, but employment did not return to its prerecession levels.</p><p>I do not disagree that the traditional Keynesian remedies remain important and necessary, as far as they go. And I share the worry that, in some cases, the specter of the robot future is used by the political center and right to distract attention from the short-term problems of the unemployed, in order to make it seem as though mass unemployment and underemployment are simply inevitable.</p><p>But I still think it&rsquo;s worth talking about what a more highly automated future could mean for all of us. That&rsquo;s partly because, contrary to the skeptics, I do think that the possibility for further labor-saving technology is being rapidly developed, even if it isn&rsquo;t yet finding its way into the economy in a way that&rsquo;s reflected in the productivity statistics. And it&rsquo;s also because even if the short-term obstacle of austerity economics and insufficient government stimulus is overcome, we still face the political question that we have faced ever since the industrial revolution: will new technologies of production lead to greater free time for all, or will we remain locked into a cycle in which productivity gains only benefit the few, while the rest of us work longer than ever?</p><h3 id=the-specter-of-climate-crisis>The Specter of Climate Crisis</h3><p>Thus far, I&rsquo;ve discussed only one of the challenges that I cited at the outset, the threat posed by technology that displaces workers. But the second, the ecological crisis, is at least as significant for the future of capitalism and of the human race. The scientific consensus about climate change is clear. Human carbon emissions are warming the atmosphere, leading to hotter temperatures, extreme weather, and shortages of water and other essential resources. Differences of opinion chiefly concern how serious the effects will be, how disruptive they will be to human civilization, and how (or whether) it will be possible to adjust to those disruptions.</p><p>Many readers will no doubt be thinking that this does not exhaust the limits of debate, for there are also those who deny the existence of human-caused climate change entirely. These people certainly exist, and they are backed by very deep-pocketed corporate interests and have prominent advocates within major political parties. But it would be a mistake to take these people as proponents of a serious scientific debate. The small fringe of writers and scientists who promote denialist theories may or may not be sincere in their claims to pursue truth, but their funders must be regarded as cynics, whose actions promote a different agenda.</p><p>For as we will see in a later chapter, the key question surrounding climate change is not whether climate change is occurring, but rather who will survive the change. Even in the worst-case scenarios, scientists are not arguing that the Earth will become totally uninhabitable. What will happen—and is happening—is that struggles over space and resources will intensify as habitats degrade. In this context—and particularly in concert with the technological trends discussed above—it may be possible for a small elite to continue to pollute the planet, protecting their own comfort while condemning most of the world&rsquo;s population to misery. It is that agenda, not any serious engagement with climate science, that drives corporate titans in the direction of denialism.</p><p>Not all capitalists are committed to denialism, however. Some who acknowledge the magnitude of climate change nevertheless insist that that we can trust the workings of the free market to deliver solutions. But while this is not in fact totally absurd, it is highly misleading. For the enlightened eco-capitalists turn out to not really be so different from the troglodyte denialists.</p><p>Entrepreneurs, we are assured, will find new green technologies that will move us away from fossil fuel dependence without government intervention. But in many cases, these innovations involve high-tech green solutions that are only accessible to the rich. At the same time, truly global solutions are rejected, even when, as in the case of taxing carbon, they are ostensibly &ldquo;market&rdquo; solutions. The initiatives that excite the eco-capitalists are, instead, fanciful projects of &ldquo;geoengineering&rdquo; that attempt to manipulate the climate, despite the uncertain efficacy and unknown side effects of such procedures. As with the Koch brothers and their denialist ilk, the eco-capitalists are concerned primarily with preserving the prerogatives and lifestyles of the elite, even if they put a more environmentalist veneer on this agenda. We will return to all of this in Chapter 4.</p><h3 id=politics-in-command>Politics in Command</h3><p>Why, the reader might ask, is it even necessary to write another book about automation and the postwork future? The topic has become an entire subgenre in recent years; Brynjolfsson and McAfee are just one example. Others include Ford&rsquo;s <em>Rise of the Robots</em> and articles from the Atlantic&rsquo;s Derek Thompson, Slate&rsquo;s Farhad Manjoo, and Mother Jones&rsquo;s Kevin Drum.[^20] Each insists that technology is rapidly making work obsolete, but they flail vainly at an answer to the problem of making sure that technology leads to shared prosperity rather than increasing inequality. At best, like Brynjolfsson and McAfee, they fall back on familiar liberal bromides: entrepreneurship and education will allow us all to thrive even if all of our current work is automated away.</p><p>The one thing missing from all these accounts, the thing I want to inject into this debate, is politics, and specifically class struggle. As Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute has pointed out, these projections of a postwork future tend toward a hazy technocratic utopianism, a &ldquo;forward projection of the Keynesian-Fordism of the past,&rdquo; in which &ldquo;prosperity leads to redistribution leads to leisure and public goods.&rdquo;[^21] Thus, while the transition may be difficult in places, we should ultimately be content with accelerating technological development and reassure ourselves that all will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds.</p><p>This outlook ignores the central defining features of the society we currently live in: capitalist class and property relations. Who benefits from automation, and who loses, is ultimately a consequence not of the robots themselves, but of who owns them. Hence it is impossible to understand the unfolding of the ecological crisis and developments in automation without understanding a third crisis through which both are mediated, the crisis of the capitalist economy. For neither climate change nor automation can be understood as problems (or solutions) in and of themselves. What is so dangerous, rather, is the way they manifest themselves in an economy dedicated to maximizing profits and growth, and in which money and power are held in the hands of a tiny elite.</p><p>The growing inequality of wealth and income in the world has become an increasing focus of attention from activists, politicians, and pundits. Occupy Wall Street struck a chord with the slogan &ldquo;we are the 99 percent,&rdquo; drawing attention to the fact that almost all the gains from economic growth in recent decades have accrued to 1 percent or less of the population. Economist Thomas Piketty scored an improbable best seller with <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>, a massive treatise about the history of wealth and the prospect of an increasingly unequal world.[^22]</p><p>The two crises I&rsquo;ve described are fundamentally about inequality as well. They are about the distribution of scarcity and abundance, about who will pay the costs of ecological damage and who will enjoy the benefits of a highly productive, automated economy. There are ways to reckon with the human impact on the Earth&rsquo;s climate, and there are ways to ensure that automation brings material prosperity for all rather than impoverishment and desperation for most. But those possible futures will require a very different kind of economic system than the one that became globally dominant by the late twentieth century.</p><h3 id=four-futures>Four Futures</h3><p>In his three-hour meditation on the representation of Los Angeles in movies, <em>Los Angeles Plays Itself</em>, film scholar Thom Andersen suggests that &ldquo;if we can appreciate documentaries for their dramatic qualities, perhaps we can appreciate fiction films for their documentary revelations.&rdquo;[^23] This book tries to incorporate that insight.</p><p>This is not quite a normal work of nonfiction, but it also is not fiction, nor would I put myself in the genre of &ldquo;futurism.&rdquo; Rather, it is an attempt to use the tools of social science in combination with those of speculative fiction to explore the space of possibilities in which our future political conflicts will play out. Call it a type of &ldquo;social science fiction.&rdquo;</p><p>One way of differentiating social science from science fiction is that the first is about describing the world that is, while the second speculates about a world that might be. But really, both are a mixture of imagination and empirical investigation, put together in different ways. Both attempt to understand empirical facts and lived experience as something that is shaped by abstract—and not directly perceptible—structural forces.</p><p>Certain types of speculative fiction are more attuned than others to the particularities of social structure and political economy. In <em>Star Wars</em>, you don&rsquo;t really care about the details of the galactic political economy. And when the author tries to flesh them out, as George Lucas did in his widely derided Star Wars prequel movies, it only gums up the story. In a world like <em>Star Trek</em>, on the other hand, these details actually matter. Even though <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> might superficially look like similar tales of space travel and swashbuckling, they are fundamentally different types of fiction. The former exists only for its characters and its mythic narrative, while the latter wants to root its characters in a richly and logically structured social world.</p><p>This is related to, but transcends, a distinction that is customarily made among science fiction fans, between &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; science fiction. The former is supposed to be more plausible by way of its grounding in present-day science. But this distinction reflects the biases of the genre&rsquo;s traditional fan base and its fetishization of the natural sciences. The more important distinction, as just mentioned, is between the stories that take their world-building seriously, and those that don&rsquo;t. What is called soft science fiction is sometimes just <em>Star Wars</em>-style adventure stories, but sometimes it makes much richer use of social science. Meanwhile many of the supposedly &ldquo;harder&rdquo; counterparts pair detailed exegeses of physics with naïve or utterly conventional understandings of social relations and human behavior. Ken MacLeod&rsquo;s Fall Revolution novels, which tell a tale of political upheaval and space colonization, are rooted in his understanding of Marxist political economy and his personal background in the Scottish socialist movement of the 1970s. It is that grounding, rather than any particular insight into the physics of space travel or Martian terraforming, that gives the novels their &ldquo;hardness.&rdquo;</p><p>Speculative fiction as a tool of social analysis and critique goes back at least as far as H. G. Wells&rsquo;s <em>The Time Machine</em>—if not Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein</em>—but the field has grown particularly rich of late. In popular culture, this can be seen even in the enormous success of dystopian young adult fictions like <em>The Hunger Games</em> and <em>Divergent</em>. But while such stories are fairly transparent allegories of the class society we already live in, it is not hard to find others who have pushed the boundary further, speculating about the long-term implications of present-day trends. The interface between the actual and the potential manifests itself most potently in the near-future fictions of those authors who place their stories just a few steps ahead of the present, like William Gibson in his early twenty-first-century series of novels (<em>Pattern Recognition</em>, <em>Spook Country</em>, <em>Zero History</em>) or Cory Doctorow in <em>Homeland</em> (and the forthcoming <em>Walkaway</em>). The significance of information technology, automation, surveillance, ecological destruction—themes that will echo throughout this book—recur in these novels.</p><p>The political implications of different imagined worlds have also begun to come to the fore. Charles Stross is both an author of social science fiction and a frequent blogger in a more social scientific mode. He has particularly criticized the popular &ldquo;steampunk&rdquo; subgenre. He notes that it presents a kind of idealized nineteenth century full of zeppelins and steam-powered gadgetry but glosses over the key social relations of that era: the Dickensian misery of the working class and the horrors of colonialism. But Stross, and others like Ken MacLeod and China Miéville, have used fictions about future, past, and alternative worlds to give a fuller picture of class and social conflict.</p><p>Fictional futures are, in my view, preferable to those works of &ldquo;futurism&rdquo; that attempt to directly predict the future, obscuring its inherent uncertainty and contingency and thereby stultifying the reader. Within the areas discussed in this book, a paradigmatic futurist would be someone like Ray Kurzweil, who confidently predicts that by 2049, computers will have achieved humanlike intelligence, with all manner of world-changing consequences.[^24] Such prognostications generally end up unconvincing as prophecy and unsatisfying as fiction. Science fiction is to futurism what social theory is to conspiracy theory: an altogether richer, more honest, and more humble enterprise. Or to put it another way, it is always more interesting to read an account that derives the general from the particular (social theory) or the particular from the general (science fiction), rather than attempting to go from the general to the general (futurism) or the particular to the particular (conspiracism).</p><p>Rosa Luxemburg, the great early twentieth-century socialist theorist and organizer, popularized a slogan: &ldquo;Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.&rdquo;[^25] That&rsquo;s truer today than it has ever been. In this book, I will suggest not two but four possible outcomes—two socialisms and two barbarisms, if you will. The four chapters that follow can be thought of as what the sociologist Max Weber called &ldquo;ideal types&rdquo;: simplified, pure models of how society can be organized, designed to illuminate a few key issues that confront us today and will confront us in the future—part social science, part science fiction. Real life, of course, is always much more complicated, but the point of an ideal type is to focus on specific issues, setting others aside.</p><p>The aim is to develop an understanding of our present moment and map the possible futures that lie ahead in stylized form. The basic assumption is that the trend toward increasing automation will continue in all domains of the economy. Moreover, I will not make the assumption that was made by most economists in the twentieth century: that even as some jobs are eliminated by mechanization, the market will automatically generate more than enough new jobs to make up for the loss.</p><p>In the spirit of working in ideal types, I will make the strongest assumption possible: all need for human labor in the production process can be eliminated, and it is possible to live a life of pure leisure while machines do all the work. In fact, this isn&rsquo;t logically possible, if we&rsquo;re imagining a world where the machines serve us rather than controlling us like those in the movie <em>The Matrix</em>. We will have to do at least a little work to manage and maintain the machines.</p><p>But I assume all human labor away to avoid entangling myself in a debate that has bedeviled the Left ever since the Industrial Revolution: how a postcapitalist society would manage labor and production, in the absence of capitalist bosses with control over the means of production. This is an important (and ongoing) debate, but the issues I&rsquo;m concerned with will be clearer if I can set it aside. Thus, the constant in my equation is that technical change tends toward perfect automation.</p><p>If automation is the constant, ecological crisis and class power are the variables. The ecological question is, more or less, just how bad the effects of climate change and resource depletion will end up being. In the best case scenario, the shift to renewable energy will combine with new methods of ameliorating and reversing climate change, and it will in fact be possible to use all our robot technology to provide a high standard of living for everyone. The spectrum, in other words, runs from scarcity to abundance.</p><p>The question of class power comes down to how we end up tackling the massive inequality of wealth, income, and political power in the world today. To the extent that the rich are able to maintain their power, we will live in a world where they enjoy the benefits of automated production, while the rest of us pay the costs of ecological destruction—if we can survive at all. To the extent that we can move toward a world of greater equality, then the future will be characterized by some combination of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity, depending on where we are on the other, ecological dimension.</p><p>So the model posits that we can end up in a world of either scarcity or abundance, alongside either hierarchy or equality. This makes for four possible combinations, which can be set up as a two-by-two grid.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Abundance</th><th>Scarcity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Equality</strong></td><td>Communism</td><td>Socialism</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hierarchy</strong></td><td>Rentism</td><td>Exterminism</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Exercises like this aren&rsquo;t unprecedented. A similar typology can be found in a 1999 article by Robert Costanza in <em>The Futurist</em>.[^26] There are four scenarios: Star Trek, Big Government, Ecotopia, and Mad Max. For Costanza, however, the two axes are &ldquo;world view and policies&rdquo; and &ldquo;the real state of the world.&rdquo; Thus the four boxes are filled in according to whether human ideological predilections match reality: in the &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo; scenario, for example, progress is restrained by safety standards because the &ldquo;technological skeptics&rdquo; deny the reality of unlimited resources.</p><p>My contribution to this debate is to emphasize the significance of capitalism and politics. Both the possibility of ecological limits and the political constraints of a class society are, in this view, &ldquo;material&rdquo; constraints. And the interaction between them is what will determine our path forward.</p><p>The existence of capitalism as a system of class power, with a ruling elite that will try to preserve itself into any possible future, is therefore a central structuring theme of this book, a theme that I believe is absent from almost every other attempt to understand the trajectory of a highly automated postindustrial economy. Technological developments give a context for social transformations, but they never determine them directly; change is always mediated by the power struggles between organized masses of people. The question is who wins and who loses, and not, as technocratic authors like Costanza would have it, who has the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; view of the objective nature of the world.</p><p>So for me, sketching out multiple futures is an attempt to leave a place for the political and the contingent. My intention is not to claim that one future will automatically appear through the magical working out of technical and ecological factors that appear from outside. Instead, it is to insist that where we end up will be a result of political struggle. The intersection of science fiction and politics is these days often associated with the libertarian right and its deterministic techno-utopian fantasies; I hope to reclaim the long left-wing tradition of mixing imaginative speculation with political economy.</p><p>The starting point of the entire analysis is that capitalism is going to end, and that, as Luxemburg said, it is either &ldquo;transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.&rdquo;[^27] So this thought experiment is an attempt to make sense of the socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is successful, and the barbarisms we may be consigned to if we fail.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean engaging in the secular eschatology that sets a firm end date on capitalism—too many socialists and apocalyptic preachers have made that mistake. It&rsquo;s too simplistic to think of discrete endings in any case; labels for social systems like &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; are abstractions, and there is never a single moment when we can definitively say that one turns into the other. My view is closer to the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck:</p><blockquote><p>The image I have of the end of capitalism—an end that I believe is already under way—is one of a social system in chronic disrepair, for reasons of its own and regardless of the absence of a viable alternative. While we cannot know when and how exactly capitalism will disappear and what will succeed it, what matters is that no force is on hand that could be expected to reverse the three downward trends in economic growth, social equality and financial stability and end their mutual reinforcement.[^28]</p></blockquote><p>The four chapters that follow are each dedicated to one of the four futures: communism, rentism, socialism, and exterminism. In addition to sketching out a plausible future, each of those four chapters emphasizes a key theme that is relevant to the world we live in now, that would assume special importance in that particular future.</p><p>The chapter on communism dwells on the way we construct meaning when life is not centered around wage labor and what kind of hierarchies and conflicts arise in a world no longer structured by the master narrative of capitalism. The depiction of rentism is largely a reflection on intellectual property and what happens when the private property form is applied to more and more of the immaterial patterns and concepts that guide our culture and economy. The story of socialism is a story about the climate crisis and our need to adapt to it, but also about the way in which some old leftist shibboleths about Nature and the Market impede us from seeing how neither the fetishization of the natural world nor the hatred of the market is necessarily sufficient, or even relevant, to the attempt to construct an ecologically stable world beyond capitalism. Finally, the tale of exterminism is the story of the militarization of the world, a phenomenon that encompasses everything from endless war in the Middle East to black teenagers being shot down by police on the streets of American cities.</p><p>We are already moving rapidly away from industrial capitalism as we understood it in the twentieth century, and there is little chance that we will move back in that direction. We are moving away into an uncertain future. I hope to provide a broad context for that future, but I do not want to create any sense of certainty. I follow David Brin, who has both written science fiction and gone by the &ldquo;futurist&rdquo; label, when he says that he is &ldquo;much more interested in exploring possibilities than likelihoods, because a great many more things might happen than actually do.&rdquo;[^29]</p><p>The importance of assessing possibility rather than likelihood is that it puts our collective action at the center, while making confident predictions only encourages passivity. In the same essay, Brin cites George Orwell&rsquo;s <em>1984</em> as a &ldquo;self-preventing prophecy&rdquo; that helped prevent the scenario it described from coming true. In the wake of the War on Terror and former National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden&rsquo;s disclosures about NSA surveillance, one can question just how self-preventing that particular prophecy was, but the general point stands.</p><p>If this book contributes in some small way to making the oppressive futures described self-preventing, and their egalitarian alternatives self-fulfilling, then it will have served its purpose.</p><hr><h2 id=1-communism-equality-and-abundance>1. Communism: Equality and Abundance</h2><p>Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s first novel, <em>Player Piano</em>, describes a society that seems, on the surface, like a postlabor utopia, where machines have liberated humans from toil. For Vonnegut, however, this isn&rsquo;t a utopia at all. He describes a future where production is almost entirely carried out by machines, overseen by a small technocratic elite. Everyone else is essentially superfluous from an economic perspective, but the society is rich enough to provide a comfortable life for all of them.</p><p>Vonnegut refers to this condition as a &ldquo;second childhood&rdquo; at one point, and he views it not as an achievement but as a horror. For him, and for the main protagonists in the novel, the main danger of an automated society is that it deprives life of all meaning and dignity. If most people are not engaged directly in producing the necessities of life, he seems to think, they will inevitably fall into torpor and despair.</p><p>There are certain ways in which the 1952 novel clearly dates itself. For one thing, this was the era of high industrialism in both the capitalist and communist worlds, based on the giant factory and the assembly line. And to be sure, today&rsquo;s economy is still reliant on this kind of massive scale production, more so than many people realize. But Vonnegut doesn&rsquo;t consider the possibility that production can become less centralized—and hence, less reliant on a managerial elite—without sliding back into less efficient, labor-intensive forms of production. Technologies like 3-D printing (and for that matter the personal computer) point in that direction.</p><p>And the notion that social meaning must come from &ldquo;productive,&rdquo; waged work is deeply rooted in patriarchal notions of the male breadwinner supporting a family. There is, throughout the book, a constant conflation between work that is rewarded with social prestige—by being regarded as a &ldquo;job&rdquo; and remunerated with a wage—and work that is materially necessary in the sense that it reproduces society and secures the conditions of life. The women in the book continue to perform the unpaid caring and emotional labor that has always been expected of them, and Vonnegut seems not to care whether this is important or a source of meaning for them.</p><p>The protagonist of <em>Player Piano</em> is Paul Proteus, a well-regarded factory manager who becomes a disillusioned critic of the system. Late in the book, he helps draft a manifesto that calls for rolling back automation on the grounds that &ldquo;men, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy unless engaged in enterprises that make them feel useful.&rdquo;[^1] But throughout the novel, Paul&rsquo;s wife Anita has been engaged in something apparently useful—namely, compensating for Paul&rsquo;s social ineptitude, and propping up his self-confidence. Reacting to Paul&rsquo;s failure to correctly interpret the social cues of a superior regarding a new job assignment, Anita argues that women &ldquo;have insight into things that men don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;[^2] Perhaps if men could learn such insights, they too might learn to provide forms of useful labor that cannot yet be automated. But such skills are not factored into the notion of productive labor that Vonnegut associates with full humanity, or at least full manhood. This gives an indication of what is really going on here, and it is what Vonnegut has already told us: men don&rsquo;t want to actually be useful, they merely want to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; useful. The problem of automation turns out to be a crisis of male feelings.</p><p>Perhaps this is why so many of Vonnegut&rsquo;s apprehensions about automation remain intractable anxieties, afflicting both our economic conversations and our popular culture. Even when we hate our jobs, sometimes we still lean on them as sources of identity and social worth. Many cannot imagine a world beyond work as anything but one of dissipation and sloth. The 2008 animated movie <em>WALL-E</em>, for example, portrays a world where all humans have departed a ruined Earth and live lives of leisure in fully automated starships. But the sympathetic protagonist of the movie is a sentient robot, left behind on Earth to pick up trash—a worker, in other words. The humans, by contrast, are grotesque—obese and torpid parodies of consumerism.</p><p>In order to imagine a totally postscarcity world as a utopia, then, it is necessary to imagine the sources of meaning and purpose in a world where we are not defined by our paid work. First, however, let us examine how such a communist society fits into our axes of hierarchy vs. equality, scarcity vs. abundance.</p><h3 id=kitchens-of-the-future>Kitchens of the Future</h3><p>Although he was best known as the author of <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, Karl Marx was reluctant to say much about the content of a communist society. Sometimes, he would speak of the transitional socialist period where workers would take over and run the existing machinery of production, but this was not what he envisioned as his ultimate political objective. That objective was communism, something that transcended labor and leisure, something that went far beyond the world of work as we understand it. But to say too much about what a communist society might ultimately look like, he thought, was a foolish exercise in writing recipes &ldquo;for the cook-shops of the future.&rdquo;[^3] History was made by the movements of the masses, he believed, not by armchair theorists.</p><p>There are moments, however, where Marx allows himself to speculate in more general terms. In the third volume of <em>Capital</em>, he distinguishes between a &ldquo;realm of necessity&rdquo; and a &ldquo;realm of freedom.&rdquo; In the realm of necessity we must &ldquo;wrestle with Nature to satisfy [our] wants, to maintain and reproduce life&rdquo; by means of physical labor in production.[^4] This realm of necessity, Marx says, exists &ldquo;in all social formations and under all possible modes of production,&rdquo; presumably including socialism.[^5] What distinguishes socialism from capitalism, then, is that production is rationally planned and democratically organized, rather than operating at the whim of the capitalist or the market. For Marx, however, this level of social development was only a precondition for &ldquo;that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis.&rdquo;[^6]</p><p>The reason this brief passage is important is that it provides a wholly different approach to postcapitalist politics than the one many of us have been taught. Those of us who were introduced to Marx in a classroom were likely told that he venerated labor and believed that it was only through laboring that human beings truly defined and realized themselves. And in some places he does say something like this, although this usually seems to refer to the value of purposive self-activity in general, rather than the more narrow phenomenon of doing something for someone else in return for a paycheck.</p><p>But in the passage above, Marx is saying something different: work has been, throughout human history, an unfortunate necessity. It&rsquo;s important to keep the lights on, and sometimes that takes work—but keeping the lights on is not what makes us human. It is merely a necessity that we can and must transcend if we are to be truly free. Freedom begins where work ends—the realm of freedom is after hours, on the weekend, on vacation, and not at work. And that remains true whether you work for a capitalist boss or a worker-owned cooperative. The space of work is still the realm of necessity and not of freedom.</p><p>Elsewhere, Marx even suggests that one day we may be able to free ourselves from the realm of necessity altogether. In <em>Critique of the Gotha Program</em>, he writes:</p><blockquote><p>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life&rsquo;s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs![^7]</p></blockquote><p>Most of us are so accustomed to capitalist relations of production that it is hard to even imagine individuals who are not subordinated to &ldquo;the division of labor.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re used to having bosses who devise plans and then instruct us to carry them out; what Marx is suggesting is that it is possible to erase the barriers between those who make plans for their own benefit and those who carry them out—which would of course mean erasing the distinction between those who manage the business and those who make it run.</p><p>But it also means something even more radical: erasing the distinction between what counts as a business and what counts as a collective leisure activity. Only in that situation might we find that &ldquo;labor has become not only a means of life but life&rsquo;s prime want.&rdquo; In that case, work wouldn&rsquo;t be work at all any more, it would be what we actually choose to do with our free time. Then we could all obey the injunction to &ldquo;do what you love&rdquo;—not as a disingenuous apology for accepting exploitation, but as a real description of the state of existence. This is Marx as stoner philosopher: just do what you feel, man (from each according to his ability), and it&rsquo;ll all be cool (to each according to his needs).</p><p>Marx&rsquo;s critics have often turned this passage against him, portraying it as a hopelessly improbable utopia. What possible society could be so productive that humans are entirely liberated from having to perform some kind of involuntary and unpleasant kinds of labor? The last chapter suggested the possibility of widespread automation that could enact such a liberation or at least approach it—if, that is, we find a way to deal with the need to secure resources and energy without causing catastrophic ecological damage.</p><p>Recent technological developments have taken place not just in the production of commodities, but in the generation of the energy needed to operate the automatic factories and 3-D printers of the future. Hence one possible postscarcity future combines labor-saving technology with an alternative to the current energy regime, which is ultimately limited by both the physical scarcity and ecological destructiveness of fossil fuels. This is far from guaranteed, but there are hopeful indicators for our ability to stabilize the climate, find sources of clean energy, and use resources wisely. These will be discussed further in Chapter 3.</p><p>But with the scarcity problem solved, would we all just sit around in dissipation and torpor as in <em>WALL-E</em>? Not if, as Marx put it, &ldquo;labor has become not only a means of life but life&rsquo;s prime want.&rdquo; Whatever activities and projects we undertook, we would participate in them because we found them inherently fulfilling, not because we needed a wage or owed our monthly hours to the cooperative. This is hardly so implausible in many areas, considering the degree to which decisions about work are already driven by nonmaterial considerations, among those who are privileged enough to have the option: millions of people choose to become teachers or social workers, or start small organic farms, even when far more lucrative careers are open to them.</p><p>The demise of wage labor may seem like a faraway dream today, but it was once the dream of the Left. The labor movement used to demand shorter hours rather than higher wages. People expected the future to look like the cartoon <em>The Jetsons</em>, whose protagonist works two hours per week, and they actually worried about what people would do after being liberated from work. In the essay &ldquo;Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,&rdquo; John Maynard Keynes predicted that within a few generations,</p><blockquote><p>man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.[^8]</p></blockquote><p>And in a discussion from 1956, the Marxist philosopher Max Horkheimer begins by casually remarking to his comrade Theodor Adorno that &ldquo;nowadays we have enough by way of productive forces; it is obvious that we could supply the entire world with goods and could then attempt to abolish work as a necessity for human beings.&rdquo;[^9]</p><h3 id=work-and-meaning>Work and Meaning</h3><p>Getting past wage labor economically also means getting past it socially, and this entails deep changes in our priorities and our way of life. As in Vonnegut&rsquo;s day, there are those who argue that even if a fully automated future is possible, it would not be desirable. They think that the inherent meaningfulness of work is the best argument against automation. They point to studies showing that unemployment has serious negative psychological and health implications for the unemployed, as evidence of the positive value of work beyond the wage it confers.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that when we talk about &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the context of a capitalist society, we can mean three different things. It can be the way we earn the money we need to survive; it can be some activity that&rsquo;s necessary for the continued existence of our society; and it can be some activity that we find inherently fulfilling, because it gives purpose and meaning to our lives. For some lucky few, it can be all three. But for many of us, it is simply the way we earn a wage, something we&rsquo;d be happy to be free of if we could—as shown by the market for lottery tickets even among those with supposedly &ldquo;good&rdquo; jobs.</p><p>Consider a study by three economists at the Free University of Berlin, which suggests a more complicated reality behind claims that waged work is a necessary source of a person&rsquo;s dignity or meaning.[^10] In a summary of their findings for a general audience, they begin by seemingly validating the consensus perspective, noting that &ldquo;people adapt surprisingly well to changes in their lives,&rdquo; but the unhappiness produced by unemployment is an exception: &ldquo;the life satisfaction of the unemployed does not restore itself even after having been unemployed for a long time.&rdquo;[^11]</p><p>However, the authors go on to ask why the unemployed are so persistently unhappy, and in doing so they clarify an ambiguity that always arises when the effects of unemployment are discussed. Is unemployment bad for people because the experience of working is good for them, or because unemployment carries a powerful social stigma? (The question leaves aside, of course, the most obvious reason for the unpleasantness of being jobless—being broke.)</p><p>To determine why unemployment is bad for people, they examine the change in self-reported life satisfaction among Germans who move from being unemployed to being retired. The authors observe that &ldquo;entering retirement brings about a change in the social category, but does not change anything else in the lives of the long-term unemployed.&rdquo; Yet they find that the shift from being unemployed to being retired brings about immediate and dramatic increases in happiness, even when controlling for other factors, thus demonstrating &ldquo;how strongly long-term unemployed people benefit from the change of their social category while retiring and the associated relief from not having to meet the social norm of being employed anymore.&rdquo;[^12]</p><p>The unemployed become happier, it turns out, as soon as they stop thinking of themselves as workers. This result suggests that the harm caused by unemployment has a lot to do with the way we, as a society, regard the unemployed. We treat paying work as a sure mark of a person&rsquo;s worth, even though this conviction has no coherent rationale.</p><p>Some who may accept this argument will still argue that the problem with transcending work is that some things simply shouldn&rsquo;t be automated, because to do so would be unacceptably dehumanizing or degrading to our society in some way. It is one thing, in other words, to automate a textile factory, but the prospect of robot nurses and diagnostic computers displacing medical employees fills many people with horror.</p><p>Reacting to the possibility of robots providing caregiver services to the elderly, sociologist Zeynep Tufekci deems the process &ldquo;inhuman.&rdquo;[^13] But it turns out that it&rsquo;s mostly the adoption of machines under conditions of capitalism she objects to, the fear that that automation will only produce unemployment and misery. I wrote this book in order to argue that another way is possible.</p><p>She does, however, raise an important point. Care work like nursing is predominantly performed by women and is not coincidentally undervalued and underpaid. So perhaps the danger is less that such work will be automated, but that it won&rsquo;t, and an underpaid, feminized workforce will be all that&rsquo;s left of wage labor. Some parts of caregiving, the changing of bedpans and the like, are the sort of unpleasant work that seems ideally suited for automation. But many elderly people rely on a nurse for emotional connection as much as for physical maintenance.</p><p>Still, even some of the more emotionally complex aspects of care aren&rsquo;t immune to replacement—if people take emotional comfort from nonsentient animals, why not from robots? Often, what humans want is simply to be around other beings that we can nurture and be loved by, beings that return our affection in a lifelike way—even if they are not sentient in the way humans are. Those without human companions will thus often satisfy this desire through their relationships with their cat or dog.</p><p>But why does that connection have to come from a human servant? For those of us who didn&rsquo;t grow up around animals, it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious what the difference is between a cute dog and a cute robot. And likewise a robot nurse could be more comforting than an overworked and exasperated human one. Not surprisingly, this approach is already being developed in Japan, an aging society with deep expertise in the technologies of cuteness and robotics.</p><p>However, Tufekci&rsquo;s critique also touches on something more profound, which goes beyond the questions of work and automation. This is what Tufekci calls &ldquo;deep emotional labor: taking care of each other.&rdquo; Taking care of each other, overcoming our isolation and loneliness, is at the essence of being human. But is what we want a world where we are all paid for that activity? Or one where we are freed from the need to work for wages so we can explore what it means to take care of ourselves and one another? My sympathies are with the second possibility and with the new possibilities and problems that might unfold in such a world.</p><p>What happens if production requires very little human labor or none at all? To see what such a society might look like, consider one of American popular culture&rsquo;s most well-known science fiction utopias: <em>Star Trek</em>. The economy and society of that show is premised on two basic technical elements. One is the technology of the &ldquo;replicator,&rdquo; which is capable of materializing any object out of thin air, with only the press of a button. The other is a fuzzily described source of apparently free (or nearly free) energy, which runs the replicators as well as everything else on the show.</p><p>The <em>Star Trek</em> television shows and movies are, at one level, simply adventure stories, space operas in which our heroes gallivant around the galaxy in a metaphor of naval exploration. But beneath that facade, the future society in which the show&rsquo;s characters live is one beyond scarcity. We could, indeed, call it a communist society, in the sense that Marx used the term, a world run according to the principle &ldquo;from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&rdquo;</p><p>The show, especially in its second-run incarnation as <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, periodically refers to this fact and pokes fun at our lowly present world of money and commodities. In one episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard encounters a man from the twentieth century, who has been in suspended animation for 400 years. Picard must patiently explain to this bewildered newcomer that his society &ldquo;eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions.&rdquo; And one of the alien species in the show, the Ferengi, are the perennial butt of jokes for their barbaric attachment to capitalism and material accumulation.</p><p>The communistic quality of the <em>Star Trek</em> universe is often obscured because the films and TV shows are centered on the military hierarchy of Starfleet, which explores the galaxy and comes into conflict with alien races. But even this seems to be largely a voluntarily chosen hierarchy, drawing those who seek a life of adventure and exploration; to the extent that we see glimpses of civilian life, it seems mostly untroubled by hierarchy or compulsion. And to the extent that the show departs from communist utopia, it is because its writers introduce the external threat of hostile alien races or scarce resources in order to produce sufficient dramatic tension. The rest of the time, the show&rsquo;s conflict turns on the quest to &ldquo;live wisely and agreeably and well.&rdquo; There are many such conflicts to imagine, as we will see.</p><h3 id=is-this-my-beautiful-life>Is This My Beautiful Life?</h3><p>Before saying more about what the important conflicts and categories of a communist society might be, a word about how we might get there.</p><p>Hostility to automation is widespread, even among those who are drawn to its potential, because they do not see how to achieve that potential without leaving most people behind. That is, if we could go from being wage workers to being taken care of by automated production, that would be wonderful, but it seems more likely that we&rsquo;ll just end up unemployed and destitute, beholden to those who own the machines.</p><p>I share Marx&rsquo;s aversion to recipes for the kitchens of the future, so I won&rsquo;t attempt some kind of programmatic account of the transition to communism. I&rsquo;ll merely suggest some basic principles.</p><p>We should not assume that the end of capitalism necessarily involves some grand revolutionary movement that merely bides its time and builds strength, before seizing the state and the means of production at one stroke—the model of Bolshevik and other insurrectionist revolutionaries. That&rsquo;s not to say, however, that some kind of dramatic rupture won&rsquo;t ultimately be necessary; it would be naïve to think that the holders of wealth and power will relinquish it voluntarily. But since we are a long way from being able to force such a reckoning, we can think in the meantime about strategies that build the alternative to capitalism before it is completely overturned. This means giving people the ability to survive and act independently of capitalist wage labor in the here and now, while at the same time facilitating their ability to gather and organize themselves politically.</p><p>The social-democratic welfare state is often thought of as the antithesis to the revolutionary project. If twentieth-century communism was about the violent overthrow of the capitalist class, the story goes, social democracy as it developed in Western Europe and elsewhere was just about ameliorating capitalism&rsquo;s worst aspects, providing a minor safety net to protect people from the vicissitudes of the market. But though it can be that, the welfare state has a more radical edge as well. The effect of the welfare state, at its most universal and generous, is to decommodify labor—in other words, to create a situation in which it possible to survive without depending on selling your labor to anyone who will pay for it.</p><p>The decommodification of labor is a concept developed by the Swedish sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen in his influential 1990 treatise on the modern welfare state, <em>The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism</em>.[^14] He proposed that one of the major axes along which different national welfare regimes varied was the degree to which they decommodified labor. The motivation for this idea is the recognition (going back to Marx) that under capitalism people&rsquo;s labor-power becomes a commodity, which they sell on the market in order to earn the means of supporting themselves. For most of us, our labor is in fact the only thing we have to sell, and selling it is the only way to get by.</p><p>Esping-Andersen describes the decommodification of labor as the situation in which you can procure your basic needs—housing, health care, or just money—without having to take a job and without having to satisfy any bureaucratic condition. To the extent that you get these things simply as a right of being a citizen, rather than in return for doing something, your labor has been decommodified.</p><p>So long as the society remains a capitalist one, it is never possible for all labor to be totally decommodified, because in that case nothing would compel workers to take a job working for someone else, and capital accumulation would grind to a halt. Capitalism doesn&rsquo;t work unless bosses can find a pool of workers who have no choice but to accept the jobs they offer. However, insofar as there are programs like unemployment protection, socialized medicine, and guaranteed income security in retirement—and insofar as eligibility for these programs is treated as a universal right—we can say that labor has been partially decommodified.</p><p>On the basis of this argument, Esping-Andersen differentiates those welfare regimes that are highly decommodifying (such as the Nordic countries) from those in which workers are still much more dependent on the market (such as the United States).</p><p>And there are those who argue that certain kinds of reforms, particularly those that decommodify labor, can point in more radical directions. The French socialist André Gorz is responsible for a well-known theorization of this idea. In one of his early works from the late 1960s, <em>Strategy for Labor</em>, he attempted to do away with the tired Left debate over &ldquo;reform or revolution&rdquo; and replace it with a new distinction.[^15] Socialists had argued endlessly, as they do to this day, about whether it was possible to use the machinery of elections and policy reforms to overcome capitalism, or whether only a violent seizure of power would do. To Gorz, this was a false debate and a distraction from the real issue:</p><blockquote><p>Is it possible from within—that is to say, without having previously destroyed capitalism—to impose anti-capitalist solutions which will not immediately be incorporated into and subordinated to the system? This is the old question of &ldquo;reform or revolution.&rdquo; This was (or is) a paramount question when the movement had (or has) the choice between a struggle for reforms and armed insurrection. Such is no longer the case in Western Europe; here there is no longer an alternative. The question here revolves around the possibility of &ldquo;revolutionary reforms,&rdquo; that is to say, of reforms which advance toward a radical transformation of society. Is this possible?[^16]</p></blockquote><p>Gorz goes on to distinguish &ldquo;reformist reforms,&rdquo; which subordinate themselves to the need to preserve the functioning of the existing system, from the radical alternative:</p><blockquote><p>A non-reformist reform is determined not in terms of what can be, but what should be. And finally, it bases the possibility of attaining its objective on the implementation of fundamental political and economic changes. These changes can be sudden, just as they can be gradual. But in any case they assume a modification of the relations of power; they assume that the workers will take over powers or assert a force (that is to say, a non-institutionalized force) strong enough to establish, maintain, and expand those tendencies within the system which serve to we</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href=/>Back to Library</a></p></article></main></body></html>

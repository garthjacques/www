My teacher gave it back with an F. She&rsquo;d underlined true and truth wherever it appeared in the essay, probably about twenty times, with a question mark beside each. She wanted to know what I meant by truth.&rdquo;</p><p>— Danielle Egan (journalist)</p></blockquote><h3 id=authors-foreword>Author&rsquo;s Foreword</h3><p>This essay is meant to restore a naive view of truth.</p><p>Someone says to you: &ldquo;My miracle snake oil can rid you of lung cancer in just three weeks.&rdquo; You reply: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t a clinical study show this claim to be untrue?&rdquo;</p><p>The one returns: &ldquo;This notion of &rsquo;truth&rsquo; is quite naive; what do you mean by &rsquo;true&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Many people, so questioned, don&rsquo;t know how to answer in exquisitely rigorous detail. Nonetheless they would not be wise to abandon the concept of &rsquo;truth&rsquo;. There was a time when no one knew the equations of gravity in exquisitely rigorous detail, yet if you walked off a cliff, you would fall.</p><p>Often I have seen – especially on Internet mailing lists – that amidst other conversation, someone says &ldquo;X is true&rdquo;, and then an argument breaks out over the use of the word &rsquo;true&rsquo;. This essay is not meant as an encyclopedic reference for that argument. Rather, I hope the arguers will read this essay, and then go back to whatever they were discussing before someone questioned the nature of truth.</p><p>In this essay I pose questions. If you see what seems like a really obvious answer, it&rsquo;s probably the answer I intend. The obvious choice isn&rsquo;t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don&rsquo;t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don&rsquo;t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four. It&rsquo;s still four even if I intone the question in a solemn, portentous tone of voice. Too simple, you say? Maybe, on this occasion, life doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be refreshing?</p><p>If you are one of those fortunate folk to whom the question seems trivial at the outset, I hope it still seems trivial at the finish. If you find yourself stumped by deep and meaningful questions, remember that if you know exactly how a system works, and could build one yourself out of buckets and pebbles, it should not be a mystery to you.</p><p>If confusion threatens when you interpret a metaphor as a metaphor, try taking everything completely literally.</p><h3 id=the-pebbles-and-the-bucket>The Pebbles and the Bucket</h3><p>Imagine that in an era before recorded history or formal mathematics, I am a shepherd and I have trouble tracking my sheep. My sheep sleep in an enclosure, a fold; and the enclosure is high enough to guard my sheep from wolves that roam by night. Each day I must release my sheep from the fold to pasture and graze; each night I must find my sheep and return them to the fold. If a sheep is left outside, I will find its body the next morning, killed and half-eaten by wolves. But it is so discouraging, to scour the fields for hours, looking for one last sheep, when I know that probably all the sheep are in the fold. Sometimes I give up early, and usually I get away with it; but around a tenth of the time there is a dead sheep the next morning.</p><p>If only there were some way to divine whether sheep are still grazing, without the inconvenience of looking! I try several methods: I toss the divination sticks of my tribe; I train my psychic powers to locate sheep through clairvoyance; I search carefully for reasons to believe all the sheep are in the fold. It makes no difference. Around a tenth of the times I turn in early, I find a dead sheep the next morning. Perhaps I realize that my methods aren&rsquo;t working, and perhaps I carefully excuse each failure; but my dilemma is still the same. I can spend an hour searching every possible nook and cranny, when most of the time there are no remaining sheep; or I can go to sleep early and lose, on the average, one-tenth of a sheep.</p><p>Late one afternoon I feel especially tired. I toss the divination sticks and the divination sticks say that all the sheep have returned. I visualize each nook and cranny, and I don&rsquo;t imagine scrying any sheep. I&rsquo;m still not confident enough, so I look inside the fold and it seems like there are a lot of sheep, and I review my earlier efforts and decide that I was especially diligent. This dissipates my anxiety, and I go to sleep. The next morning I discover two dead sheep. Something inside me snaps, and I begin thinking creatively.</p><p>That day, loud hammering noises come from the gate of the sheepfold&rsquo;s enclosure.</p><p>The next morning, I open the gate of the enclosure only a little way, and as each sheep passes out of the enclosure, I drop a pebble into a bucket nailed up next to the door. In the afternoon, as each returning sheep passes by, I take one pebble out of the bucket. When there are no pebbles left in the bucket, I can stop searching and turn in for the night. It is a brilliant notion. It will revolutionize shepherding.</p><p>That was the theory. In practice, it took considerable refinement before the method worked reliably. Several times I searched for hours and didn&rsquo;t find any sheep, and the next morning there were no stragglers. On each of these occasions it required deep thought to figure out where my bucket system had failed. On returning from one fruitless search, I thought back and realized that the bucket already contained pebbles when I started; this, it turned out, was a bad idea. Another time I randomly tossed pebbles into the bucket, to amuse myself, between the morning and the afternoon; this too was a bad idea, as I realized after searching for a few hours. But I practiced my pebblecraft, and became a reasonably proficient pebblecrafter.</p><p>One afternoon, a man richly attired in white robes, leafy laurels, sandals, and business suit trudges in along the sandy trail that leads to my pastures.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; I inquire.</p><p>The man takes a badge from his coat and flips it open, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is Markos Sophisticus Maximus, a delegate from the Senate of Rum. (One might wonder whether another could steal the badge; but so great is the power of these badges that if any other were to use them, they would in that instant be transformed into Markos.)</p><p>&ldquo;Call me Mark,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to confiscate the magic pebbles, in the name of the Senate; artifacts of such great power must not fall into ignorant hands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That bleeding apprentice,&rdquo; I grouse under my breath, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been yakking to the villagers again.&rdquo; Then I look at Mark&rsquo;s stern face, and sigh. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t magic pebbles,&rdquo; I say aloud. &ldquo;Just ordinary stones I picked up from the ground.&rdquo;</p><p>A flicker of confusion crosses Mark&rsquo;s face, then he brightens again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for the magic bucket!&rdquo; he declares.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a magic bucket,&rdquo; I say wearily. &ldquo;I used to keep dirty socks in it.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark&rsquo;s face is puzzled. &ldquo;Then where is the magic?&rdquo; he demands.</p><p>An interesting question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain,&rdquo; I say.</p><p>My current apprentice, Autrey, attracted by the commotion, wanders over and volunteers his explanation: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the level of pebbles in the bucket,&rdquo; Autrey says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a magic level of pebbles, and you have to get the level just right, or it doesn&rsquo;t work. If you throw in more pebbles, or take some out, the bucket won&rsquo;t be at the magic level anymore. Right now, the magic level is,&rdquo; Autrey peers into the bucket, &ldquo;about one-third full.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; Mark says excitedly. From his back pocket Mark takes out his own bucket, and a heap of pebbles. Then he grabs a few handfuls of pebbles, and stuffs them into the bucket. Then Mark looks into the bucket, noting how many pebbles are there. &ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; Mark says, &ldquo;the magic level of this bucket is half full. Like that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Autrey says sharply. &ldquo;Half full is not the magic level. The magic level is about one-third. Half full is definitely unmagic. Furthermore, you&rsquo;re using the wrong bucket.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark turns to me, puzzled. &ldquo;I thought you said the bucket wasn&rsquo;t magic?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; I say. A sheep passes out through the gate, and I toss another pebble into the bucket. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m watching the sheep. Talk to Autrey.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark dubiously eyes the pebble I tossed in, but decides to temporarily shelve the question. Mark turns to Autrey and draws himself up haughtily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a free country,&rdquo; Mark says, &ldquo;under the benevolent dictatorship of the Senate, of course. I can drop whichever pebbles I like into whatever bucket I like.&rdquo;</p><p>Autrey considers this. &ldquo;No you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says finally, &ldquo;there won&rsquo;t be any magic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; says Mark patiently, &ldquo;I watched you carefully. You looked in your bucket, checked the level of pebbles, and called that the magic level. I did exactly the same thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how it works,&rdquo; says Autrey.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; says Mark, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the level of pebbles in my bucket that&rsquo;s magic, it&rsquo;s the level of pebbles in your bucket. Is that what you claim? What makes your bucket so much better than mine, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Autrey, &ldquo;if we were to empty your bucket, and then pour all the pebbles from my bucket into your bucket, then your bucket would have the magic level. There&rsquo;s also a procedure we can use to check if your bucket has the magic level, if we know that my bucket has the magic level; we call that a bucket compare operation.&rdquo;</p><p>Another sheep passes, and I toss in another pebble.</p><p>&ldquo;He just tossed in another pebble!&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;And I suppose you claim the new level is also magic? I could toss pebbles into your bucket until the level was the same as mine, and then our buckets would agree. You&rsquo;re just comparing my bucket to your bucket to determine whether you think the level is &lsquo;magic&rsquo; or not. Well, I think your bucket isn&rsquo;t magic, because it doesn&rsquo;t have the same level of pebbles as mine. So there!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; says Autrey, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By &lsquo;magic level&rsquo;, you mean simply the level of pebbles in your own bucket. And when I say &lsquo;magic level&rsquo;, I mean the level of pebbles in my bucket. Thus you look at my bucket and say it &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t magic&rsquo;, but the word &lsquo;magic&rsquo; means different things to different people. You need to specify whose magic it is. You should say that my bucket doesn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Autrey&rsquo;s magic level&rsquo;, and I say that your bucket doesn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Mark&rsquo;s magic level&rsquo;. That way, the apparent contradiction goes away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But -&rdquo; says Autrey helplessly.</p><p>&ldquo;Different people can have different buckets with different levels of pebbles, which proves this business about &lsquo;magic&rsquo; is completely arbitrary and subjective.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;did anyone tell you what these pebbles do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;I thought they were just magic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If the pebbles didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; says Autrey, &ldquo;our ISO 9000 process efficiency auditor would eliminate the procedure from our daily work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your auditor&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darwin,&rdquo; says Autrey.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;Charles does have a reputation as a strict auditor. So do the pebbles bless the flocks, and cause the increase of sheep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;The virtue of the pebbles is this; if we look into the bucket and see the bucket is empty of pebbles, we know the pastures are likewise empty of sheep. If we do not use the bucket, we must search and search until dark, lest one last sheep remain. Or if we stop our work early, then sometimes the next morning we find a dead sheep, for the wolves savage any sheep left outside. If we look in the bucket, we know when all the sheep are home, and we can retire without fear.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark considers this. &ldquo;That sounds rather implausible,&rdquo; he says eventually. &ldquo;Did you consider using divination sticks? Divination sticks are infallible, or at least, anyone who says they are fallible is burned at the stake. This is an extremely painful way to die; it follows that divination sticks are infallible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to use divination sticks if you like,&rdquo; I say.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good heavens, of course not,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;They work infallibly, with absolute perfection on every occasion, as befits such blessed instruments; but what if there were a dead sheep the next morning? I only use the divination sticks when there is no possibility of their being proven wrong. Otherwise I might be burned alive. So how does your magic bucket work?&rdquo;</p><p>How does the bucket work&mldr;? I&rsquo;d better start with the simplest possible case.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;suppose the pastures are empty, and the bucket isn&rsquo;t empty. Then we&rsquo;ll waste hours looking for a sheep that isn&rsquo;t there. And if there are sheep in the pastures, but the bucket is empty, then Autrey and I will turn in too early, and we&rsquo;ll find dead sheep the next morning. So an empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures are empty -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;That sounds like a vacuous tautology to me. Aren&rsquo;t an empty bucket and empty pastures obviously the same thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not vacuous,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an analogy: The logician Alfred Tarski once said that the assertion &lsquo;Snow is white&rsquo; is true if and only if snow is white. If you can understand that, you should be able to see why an empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures are empty of sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;These are buckets. They don&rsquo;t have anything to do with sheep. Buckets and sheep are obviously completely different. There&rsquo;s no way the sheep can ever interact with the bucket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then where do you think the magic comes from?&rdquo; inquires Autrey.</p><p>Mark considers. &ldquo;You said you could compare two buckets to check if they had the same level&mldr; I can see how buckets can interact with buckets. Maybe when you get a large collection of buckets, and they all have the same level, that&rsquo;s what generates the magic. I&rsquo;ll call that the coherentist theory of magic buckets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;I know that my master is working on a system with multiple buckets – he says it might work better because of &lsquo;redundancy&rsquo; and &rsquo;error correction&rsquo;. That sounds like coherentism to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not quite the same -&rdquo; I start to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s test the coherentism theory of magic,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;ve got five more buckets in your back pocket. I&rsquo;ll hand you the bucket we&rsquo;re using, and then you can fill up your other buckets to the same level -&rdquo;</p><p>Mark recoils in horror. &ldquo;Stop! These buckets have been passed down in my family for generations, and they&rsquo;ve always had the same level! If I accept your bucket, my bucket collection will become less coherent, and the magic will go away!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But your current buckets don&rsquo;t have anything to do with the sheep!&rdquo; protests Autrey.</p><p>Mark looks exasperated. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ve explained before, there&rsquo;s obviously no way that sheep can interact with buckets. Buckets can only interact with other buckets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I toss in a pebble whenever a sheep passes,&rdquo; I point out.</p><p>&ldquo;When a sheep passes, you toss in a pebble?&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;What does that have to do with anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an interaction between the sheep and the pebbles,&rdquo; I reply.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s an interaction between the pebbles and you,&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;The magic doesn&rsquo;t come from the sheep, it comes from you. Mere sheep are obviously nonmagical. The magic has to come from somewhere, on the way to the bucket.&rdquo;</p><p>I point at a wooden mechanism perched on the gate. &ldquo;Do you see that flap of cloth hanging down from that wooden contraption? We&rsquo;re still fiddling with that – it doesn&rsquo;t work reliably – but when sheep pass through, they disturb the cloth. When the cloth moves aside, a pebble drops out of a reservoir and falls into the bucket. That way, Autrey and I won&rsquo;t have to toss in the pebbles ourselves.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark furrows his brow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you&mldr; is the cloth magical?&rdquo;</p><p>I shrug. &ldquo;I ordered it online from a company called Natural Selections. The fabric is called Sensory Modality.&rdquo; I pause, seeing the incredulous expressions of Mark and Autrey. &ldquo;I admit the names are a bit New Agey. The point is that a passing sheep triggers a chain of cause and effect that ends with a pebble in the bucket. Afterward you can compare the bucket to other buckets, and so on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fit a sheep into a bucket. Only pebbles go in buckets, and it&rsquo;s obvious that pebbles only interact with other pebbles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sheep interact with things that interact with pebbles&mldr;&rdquo; I search for an analogy. &ldquo;Suppose you look down at your shoelaces. A photon leaves the Sun; then travels down through Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere; then bounces off your shoelaces; then passes through the pupil of your eye; then strikes the retina; then is absorbed by a rod or a cone. The photon&rsquo;s energy makes the attached neuron fire, which causes other neurons to fire. A neural activation pattern in your visual cortex can interact with your beliefs about your shoelaces, since beliefs about shoelaces also exist in neural substrate. If you can understand that, you should be able to see how a passing sheep causes a pebble to enter the bucket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At exactly which point in the process does the pebble become magic?&rdquo; says Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;It&mldr; um&mldr;&rdquo; Now I&rsquo;m starting to get confused. I shake my head to clear away cobwebs. This all seemed simple enough when I woke up this morning, and the pebble-and-bucket system hasn&rsquo;t gotten any more complicated since then. &ldquo;This is a lot easier to understand if you remember that the point of the system is to keep track of sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark sighs sadly. &ldquo;Never mind&mldr; it&rsquo;s obvious you don&rsquo;t know. Maybe all pebbles are magical to start with, even before they enter the bucket. We could call that position panpebblism.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Autrey says, scorn rich in his voice. &ldquo;Mere wishful thinking! Not all pebbles are created equal. The pebbles in your bucket are not magical. They&rsquo;re only lumps of stone!&rdquo;</p><p>Mark&rsquo;s face turns stern. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;now you see the danger of the road you walk! Once you say that some people&rsquo;s pebbles are magical and some are not, your pride will consume you! You will think yourself superior to all others, and so fall! Many throughout history have tortured and murdered because they thought their own pebbles supreme!&rdquo; A tinge of condescension enters Mark&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Worshipping a level of pebbles as &lsquo;magical&rsquo; implies that there&rsquo;s an absolute pebble level in a Supreme Bucket. Nobody believes in a Supreme Bucket these days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Sheep are not absolute pebbles. Two, I don&rsquo;t think my bucket actually contains the sheep. Three, I don&rsquo;t worship my bucket level as perfect – I adjust it sometimes – and I do that because I care about the sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; says Autrey, &ldquo;someone who believes that possessing absolute pebbles would license torture and murder, is making a mistake that has nothing to do with buckets. You&rsquo;re solving the wrong problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark calms himself down. &ldquo;I suppose I can&rsquo;t expect any better from mere shepherds. You probably believe that snow is white, don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&mldr; yes?&rdquo; says Autrey.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother you that Joseph Stalin believed that snow is white?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&mldr; no?&rdquo; says Autrey.</p><p>Mark gazes incredulously at Autrey, and finally shrugs. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s suppose, purely for the sake of argument, that your pebbles are magical and mine aren&rsquo;t. Can you tell me what the difference is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My pebbles represent the sheep!&rdquo; Autrey says triumphantly. &ldquo;Your pebbles don&rsquo;t have the representativeness property, so they won&rsquo;t work. They are empty of meaning. Just look at them. There&rsquo;s no aura of semantic content; they are merely pebbles. You need a bucket with special causal powers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;Special causal powers, instead of magic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not superstitious. Postulating magic, in this day and age, would be unacceptable to the international shepherding community. We have found that postulating magic simply doesn&rsquo;t work as an explanation for shepherding phenomena. So when I see something I don&rsquo;t understand, and I want to explain it using a model with no internal detail that makes no predictions even in retrospect, I postulate special causal powers. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll move on to calling it an emergent phenomenon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of special powers does the bucket have?&rdquo; asks Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;Maybe this bucket is imbued with an about-ness relation to the pastures. That would explain why it worked–when the bucket is empty, it means the pastures are empty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you find this bucket?&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;And how did you realize it had an about-ness relation to the pastures?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ordinary bucket,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I used to climb trees with it&mldr; I don&rsquo;t think this question needs to be difficult.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking to Autrey,&rdquo; says Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to bind the bucket to the pastures, and the pebbles to the sheep, using a magical ritual – pardon me, an emergent process with special causal powers – that my master discovered,&rdquo; Autrey explains.</p><p>Autrey then attempts to describe the ritual, with Mark nodding along in sage comprehension.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to throw in a pebble every time a sheep leaves through the gate?&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;Take out a pebble every time a sheep returns?&rdquo;</p><p>Autrey nods. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That must be really hard,&rdquo; Mark says sympathetically.</p><p>Autrey brightens, soaking up Mark&rsquo;s sympathy like rain. &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely hard on your emotions. When the bucket has held its level for a while, you&mldr; tend to get attached to that level.&rdquo;</p><p>A sheep passes then, leaving through the gate. Autrey sees; he stoops, picks up a pebble, holds it aloft in the air. &ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; Autrey proclaims. &ldquo;A sheep has passed! I must now toss a pebble into this bucket, my dear bucket, and destroy that fond level which has held for so long –&rdquo; Another sheep passes. Autrey, caught up in his drama, misses it; so I plunk a pebble into the bucket. Autrey is still speaking: " – for that is the supreme test of the shepherd, to throw in the pebble, be it ever so agonizing, be the old level ever so precious. Indeed, only the best of shepherds can meet a requirement so stern -"</p><p>&ldquo;Autrey,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;if you want to be a great shepherd someday, learn to shut up and throw in the pebble. No fuss. No drama. Just do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And this ritual,&rdquo; says Mark, &ldquo;it binds the pebbles to the sheep by the magical laws of Sympathy and Contagion, like a voodoo doll.&rdquo;</p><p>Autrey winces and looks around. &ldquo;Please! Don&rsquo;t call it Sympathy and Contagion. We shepherds are an anti-superstitious folk. Use the word &lsquo;intentionality&rsquo;, or something like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I look at a pebble?&rdquo; says Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I say. I take one of the pebbles out of the bucket, and toss it to Mark. Then I reach to the ground, pick up another pebble, and drop it into the bucket. Autrey looks at me, puzzled. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you just mess it up?&rdquo;</p><p>I shrug. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. We&rsquo;ll know I messed it up if there&rsquo;s a dead sheep next morning, or if we search for a few hours and don&rsquo;t find any sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But -&rdquo; Autrey says.</p><p>&ldquo;I taught you everything you know, but I haven&rsquo;t taught you everything I know,&rdquo; I say.</p><p>Mark is examining the pebble, staring at it intently. He holds his hand over the pebble and mutters a few words, then shakes his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sense any magical power,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Pardon me. I don&rsquo;t sense any intentionality.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A pebble only has intentionality if it&rsquo;s inside a ma- an emergent bucket,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;Otherwise it&rsquo;s just a mere pebble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a problem,&rdquo; I say. I take a pebble out of the bucket, and toss it away. Then I walk over to where Mark stands, tap his hand holding a pebble, and say: &ldquo;I declare this hand to be part of the magic bucket!&rdquo; Then I resume my post at the gates.</p><p>Autrey laughs. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just being gratuitously evil.&rdquo;</p><p>I nod, for this is indeed the case.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that really going to work, though?&rdquo; says Autrey.</p><p>I nod again, hoping that I&rsquo;m right. I&rsquo;ve done this before with two buckets, and in principle, there should be no difference between Mark&rsquo;s hand and a bucket. Even if Mark&rsquo;s hand is imbued with the elan vital that distinguishes live matter from dead matter, the trick should work as well as if Mark were a marble statue.</p><p>Mark is looking at his hand, a bit unnerved. &ldquo;So&mldr; the pebble has intentionality again, now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t add any more pebbles to your hand, or throw away the one you have, or you&rsquo;ll break the ritual.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark nods solemnly. Then he resumes inspecting the pebble. &ldquo;I understand now how your flocks grew so great,&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;With the power of this bucket, you could keep tossing pebbles, and the sheep would keep returning from the fields. You could start with just a few sheep, let them leave, then fill the bucket to the brim before they returned. And if tending so many sheep grew tedious, you could let them all leave, then empty almost all the pebbles from the bucket, so that only a few returned&mldr; increasing the flocks again when it came time for shearing&mldr; dear heavens, man! Do you realize the sheer power of this ritual you&rsquo;ve discovered? I can only imagine the implications; humankind might leap ahead a decade – no, a century!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work that way,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;If you add a pebble when a sheep hasn&rsquo;t left, or remove a pebble when a sheep hasn&rsquo;t come in, that breaks the ritual. The power does not linger in the pebbles, but vanishes all at once, like a soap bubble popping.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark&rsquo;s face is terribly disappointed. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>I nod. &ldquo;I tried that and it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark sighs heavily. &ldquo;And this&mldr; math&mldr; seemed so powerful and useful until then&mldr; Oh, well. So much for human progress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mark, it was a brilliant idea,&rdquo; Autrey says encouragingly. &ldquo;The notion didn&rsquo;t occur to me, and yet it&rsquo;s so obvious&mldr; it would save an enormous amount of effort&mldr; there must be a way to salvage your plan! We could try different buckets, looking for one that would keep the magical pow- the intentionality in the pebbles, even without the ritual. Or try other pebbles. Maybe our pebbles just have the wrong properties to have inherent intentionality. What if we tried it using stones carved to resemble tiny sheep? Or just write &lsquo;sheep&rsquo; on the pebbles; that might be enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not going to work,&rdquo; I predict dryly.</p><p>Autrey continues. &ldquo;Maybe we need organic pebbles, instead of silicon pebbles&mldr; or maybe we need to use expensive gemstones. The price of gemstones doubles every eighteen months, so you could buy a handful of cheap gemstones now, and wait, and in twenty years they&rsquo;d be really expensive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You tried adding pebbles to create more sheep, and it didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; Mark asks me. &ldquo;What exactly did you do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I took a handful of dollar bills. Then I hid the dollar bills under a fold of my blanket, one by one; each time I hid another bill, I took another paperclip from a box, making a small heap. I was careful not to keep track in my head, so that all I knew was that there were &lsquo;many&rsquo; dollar bills, and &lsquo;many&rsquo; paperclips. Then when all the bills were hidden under my blanket, I added a single additional paperclip to the heap, the equivalent of tossing an extra pebble into the bucket. Then I started taking dollar bills from under the fold, and putting the paperclips back into the box. When I finished, a single paperclip was left over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does that result mean?&rdquo; asks Autrey.</p><p>&ldquo;It means the trick didn&rsquo;t work. Once I broke ritual by that single misstep, the power did not linger, but vanished instantly; the heap of paperclips and the pile of dollar bills no longer went empty at the same time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You actually tried this?&rdquo; asks Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I actually performed the experiment, to verify that the outcome matched my theoretical prediction. I have a sentimental fondness for the scientific method, even when it seems absurd. Besides, what if I&rsquo;d been wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it had worked,&rdquo; says Mark, &ldquo;you would have been guilty of counterfeiting! Imagine if everyone did that; the economy would collapse! Everyone would have billions of dollars of currency, yet there would be nothing for money to buy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I reply. &ldquo;By that same logic whereby adding another paperclip to the heap creates another dollar bill, creating another dollar bill would create an additional dollar&rsquo;s worth of goods and services.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark shakes his head. &ldquo;Counterfeiting is still a crime&mldr; You should not have tried.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was reasonably confident I would fail.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;You expected to fail! You didn&rsquo;t believe you could do it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I admit. &ldquo;You have guessed my expectations with stunning accuracy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the problem,&rdquo; Mark says briskly. &ldquo;Magic is fueled by belief and willpower. If you don&rsquo;t believe you can do it, you can&rsquo;t. You need to change your belief about the experimental result; that will change the result itself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; I say nostalgically, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Autrey said when I told him about the pebble-and-bucket method. That it was too ridiculous for him to believe, so it wouldn&rsquo;t work for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you persuade him?&rdquo; inquires Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him to shut up and follow instructions,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;and when the method worked, Autrey started believing in it.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark frowns, puzzled. &ldquo;That makes no sense. It doesn&rsquo;t resolve the essential chicken-and-egg dilemma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure it does. The bucket method works whether or not you believe in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo; sputters Mark. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that too,&rdquo; chimes in Autrey. &ldquo;Apparently I was wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark screws up his face in concentration. &ldquo;But&mldr; if you didn&rsquo;t believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it, then why did the bucket method work when you didn&rsquo;t believe in it? Did you believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it whether or not you believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mldr; think so&mldr;&rdquo; says Autrey doubtfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Then if you didn&rsquo;t believe in magic that works whether or not you&mldr; hold on a second, I need to work this out on paper and pencil -&rdquo; Mark scribbles frantically, looks skeptically at the result, turns the piece of paper upside down, then gives up. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;Magic is difficult enough for me to comprehend; metamagic is out of my depth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mark, I don&rsquo;t think you understand the art of bucketcraft,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about using pebbles to control sheep. It&rsquo;s about making sheep control pebbles. In this art, it is not necessary to begin by believing the art will work. Rather, first the art works, then one comes to believe that it works.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or so you believe,&rdquo; says Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;So I believe,&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;because it happens to be a fact. The correspondence between reality and my beliefs comes from reality controlling my beliefs, not the other way around.&rdquo;</p><p>Another sheep passes, causing me to toss in another pebble.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Now we come to the root of the problem,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this so-called &lsquo;reality&rsquo; business? I understand what it means for a hypothesis to be elegant, or falsifiable, or compatible with the evidence. It sounds to me like calling a belief &rsquo;true&rsquo; or &lsquo;real&rsquo; or &lsquo;actual&rsquo; is merely the difference between saying you believe something, and saying you really really believe something.&rdquo;</p><p>I pause. &ldquo;Well&mldr;&rdquo; I say slowly. &ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure myself where this &lsquo;reality&rsquo; business comes from. I can&rsquo;t create my own reality in the lab, so I must not understand it yet. But occasionally I believe strongly that something is going to happen, and then something else happens instead. I need a name for whatever-it-is that determines my experimental results, so I call it &lsquo;reality&rsquo;. This &lsquo;reality&rsquo; is somehow separate from even my very best hypotheses. Even when I have a simple hypothesis, strongly supported by all the evidence I know, sometimes I&rsquo;m still surprised. So I need different names for the thingies that determine my predictions and the thingy that determines my experimental results. I call the former thingies &lsquo;belief&rsquo;, and the latter thingy &lsquo;reality&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark snorts. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know why I bother listening to this obvious nonsense. Whatever you say about this so-called &lsquo;reality&rsquo;, it is merely another belief. Even your belief that reality precedes your beliefs is a belief. It follows, as a logical inevitability, that reality does not exist; only beliefs exist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; says Autrey, &ldquo;could you repeat that last part? You lost me with that sharp swerve there in the middle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No matter what you say about reality, it&rsquo;s just another belief,&rdquo; explains Mark. &ldquo;It follows with crushing necessity that there is no reality, only beliefs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;The same way that no matter what you eat, you need to eat it with your mouth. It follows that there is no food, only mouths.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;Everything that you eat has to be in your mouth. How can there be food that exists outside your mouth? The thought is nonsense, proving that &lsquo;food&rsquo; is an incoherent notion. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re all starving to death; there&rsquo;s no food.&rdquo;</p><p>Autrey looks down at his stomach. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not starving to death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; shouts Mark triumphantly. &ldquo;And how did you utter that very objection? With your mouth, my friend! With your mouth! What better demonstration could you ask that there is no food?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about starvation?&rdquo; demands a harsh, rasping voice from directly behind us. Autrey and I stay calm, having gone through this before. Mark leaps a foot in the air, startled almost out of his wits.</p><p>Inspector Darwin smiles tightly, pleased at achieving surprise, and makes a small tick on his clipboard.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a metaphor!&rdquo; Mark says quickly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to take away my mouth, or anything like that -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you need a mouth if there is no food?&rdquo; demands Darwin angrily. &ldquo;Never mind. I have no time for this foolishness. I am here to inspect the sheep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Flocks thriving, sir,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;No dead sheep since January.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent. I award you 0.12 units of fitness. Now what is this person doing here? Is he a necessary part of the operations?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as I can see, he would be of more use to the human species if hung off a hot-air balloon as ballast,&rdquo; I say.</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; says Autrey mildly.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not care about the human species. Let him speak for himself.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark draws himself up haughtily. &ldquo;This mere shepherd,&rdquo; he says, gesturing at me, &ldquo;has claimed that there is such a thing as reality. This offends me, for I know with deep and abiding certainty that there is no truth. The concept of &rsquo;truth&rsquo; is merely a stratagem for people to impose their own beliefs on others. Every culture has a different &rsquo;truth&rsquo;, and no culture&rsquo;s &rsquo;truth&rsquo; is superior to any other. This that I have said holds at all times in all places, and I insist that you agree.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on a second,&rdquo; says Autrey. &ldquo;If nothing is true, why should I believe you when you say that nothing is true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that nothing is true -&rdquo; says Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you did,&rdquo; interjects Autrey, &ldquo;I heard you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;- I said that &rsquo;truth&rsquo; is an excuse used by some cultures to enforce their beliefs on others. So when you say something is &rsquo;true&rsquo;, you mean only that it would be advantageous to your own social group to have it believed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And this that you have said,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;is it true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely, positively true!&rdquo; says Mark emphatically. &ldquo;People create their own realities.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; says Autrey, sounding puzzled again, &ldquo;saying that people create their own realities is, logically, a completely separate issue from saying that there is no truth, a state of affairs I cannot even imagine coherently, perhaps because you still have not explained how exactly it is supposed to work -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There you go again,&rdquo; says Mark exasperatedly, &ldquo;trying to apply your Western concepts of logic, rationality, reason, coherence, and self-consistency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; mutters Autrey, &ldquo;now I need to add a third subject heading, to keep track of this entirely separate and distinct claim -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not separate,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;re taking the wrong attitude by treating my statements as hypotheses, and carefully deriving their consequences. You need to think of them as fully general excuses, which I apply when anyone says something I don&rsquo;t like. It&rsquo;s not so much a model of how the universe works, as a &ldquo;Get Out of Jail Free&rdquo; card. The key is to apply the excuse selectively. When I say that there is no such thing as truth, that applies only to your claim that the magic bucket works whether or not I believe in it. It does not apply to my claim that there is no such thing as truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&mldr; why not?&rdquo; inquires Autrey.</p><p>Mark heaves a patient sigh. &ldquo;Autrey, do you think you&rsquo;re the first person to think of that question? To ask us how our own beliefs can be meaningful if all beliefs are meaningless? That&rsquo;s the same thing many students say when they encounter this philosophy, which, I&rsquo;ll have you know, has many adherents and an extensive literature.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; says Autrey.</p><p>&ldquo;We named it the &lsquo;reflexivity problem&rsquo;,&rdquo; explains Mark.</p><p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; persists Autrey.</p><p>Mark smiles condescendingly. &ldquo;Believe me, Autrey, you&rsquo;re not the first person to think of such a simple question. There&rsquo;s no point in presenting it to us as a triumphant refutation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the actual answer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;d like to move on to the issue of how logic kills cute baby seals -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are wasting time,&rdquo; snaps Inspector Darwin.</p><p>&ldquo;Not to mention, losing track of sheep,&rdquo; I say, tossing in another pebble.</p><p>Inspector Darwin looks at the two arguers, both apparently unwilling to give up their positions. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Darwin says, more kindly now, &ldquo;I have a simple notion for resolving your dispute. You say,&rdquo; says Darwin, pointing to Mark, &ldquo;that people&rsquo;s beliefs alter their personal realities. And you fervently believe,&rdquo; his finger swivels to point at Autrey, &ldquo;that Mark&rsquo;s beliefs can&rsquo;t alter reality. So let Mark believe really hard that he can fly, and then step off a cliff. Mark shall see himself fly away like a bird, and Autrey shall see him plummet down and go splat, and you shall both be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>We all pause, considering this.</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds reasonable&mldr;&rdquo; Mark says finally.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cliff right there,&rdquo; observes Inspector Darwin.</p><p>Autrey is wearing a look of intense concentration. Finally he shouts: &ldquo;Wait! If that were true, we would all have long since departed into our own private universes, in which case the other people here are only figments of your imagination – there&rsquo;s no point in trying to prove anything to us -&rdquo;</p><p>A long dwindling scream comes from the nearby cliff, followed by a dull and lonely splat. Inspector Darwin flips his clipboard to the page that shows the current gene pool and pencils in a slightly lower frequency for Mark&rsquo;s alleles.</p><p>Autrey looks slightly sick. &ldquo;Was that really necessary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Necessary?&rdquo; says Inspector Darwin, sounding puzzled. &ldquo;It just happened&mldr; I don&rsquo;t quite understand your question.&rdquo;</p><p>Autrey and I turn back to our bucket. It&rsquo;s time to bring in the sheep. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to forget about that part. Otherwise what would be the point?</p><h2 id=what-do-we-mean-by-rationality>What Do We Mean By &ldquo;Rationality&rdquo;?</h2><p>We mean:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Epistemic rationality</strong>: believing, and updating on evidence, so as to systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the territory. The art of obtaining beliefs that correspond to reality as closely as possible. This correspondence is commonly termed &ldquo;truth&rdquo; or &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo;, and we&rsquo;re happy to call it that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Instrumental rationality</strong>: achieving your values. Not necessarily &ldquo;your values&rdquo; in the sense of being selfish values or unshared values: &ldquo;your values&rdquo; means anything you care about. The art of choosing actions that steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. On LW we sometimes refer to this as &ldquo;winning&rdquo;.</p></li></ol><p>If that seems like a perfectly good definition, you can stop reading here; otherwise continue.</p><p>Sometimes experimental psychologists uncover human reasoning that seems very strange - for example, someone rates the probability &ldquo;Bill plays jazz&rdquo; as less than the probability &ldquo;Bill is an accountant who plays jazz&rdquo;. This seems like an odd judgment, since any particular jazz-playing accountant is obviously a jazz player. But to what higher vantage point do we appeal in saying that the judgment is wrong?</p><p>Experimental psychologists use two gold standards: probability theory, and decision theory. Since it is a universal law of probability theory that P(A) ≥ P(A & B), the judgment P(&ldquo;Bill plays jazz&rdquo;) &lt; P(&ldquo;Bill plays jazz&rdquo; & &ldquo;Bill is accountant&rdquo;) is labeled incorrect.</p><p>To keep it technical, you would say that this probability judgment is non-Bayesian. Beliefs that conform to a coherent probability distribution, and decisions that maximize the probabilistic expectation of a coherent utility function, are called &ldquo;Bayesian&rdquo;.</p><p>This does not quite exhaust the problem of what is meant in practice by &ldquo;rationality&rdquo;, for two major reasons:</p><p>First, the Bayesian formalisms in their full form are computationally intractable on most real-world problems. No one can actually calculate and obey the math, any more than you can predict the stock market by calculating the movements of quarks.</p><p>This is why we have a whole site called &ldquo;LessWrong&rdquo;, rather than simply stating the formal axioms and being done. There&rsquo;s a whole further art to finding the truth and accomplishing value from inside a human mind: we have to learn our own flaws, overcome our biases, prevent ourselves from self-deceiving, get ourselves into good emotional shape to confront the truth and do what needs doing, etcetera etcetera and so on.</p><p>Second, sometimes the meaning of the math itself is called into question. The exact rules of probability theory are called into question by e.g. anthropic problems in which the number of observers is uncertain. The exact rules of decision theory are called into question by e.g. Newcomb-like problems in which other agents may predict your decision before it happens.</p><p>In cases like these, it is futile to try to settle the problem by coming up with some new definition of the word &ldquo;rational&rdquo;, and saying, &ldquo;Therefore my preferred answer, by definition, is what is meant by the word &lsquo;rational&rsquo;.&rdquo; This simply begs the question of why anyone should pay attention to your definition. We aren&rsquo;t interested in probability theory because it is the holy word handed down from Laplace. We&rsquo;re interested in Bayesian-style belief-updating (with Occam priors) because we expect that this style of thinking gets us systematically closer to, you know, accuracy, the map that reflects the territory. (More on the futility of arguing &ldquo;by definition&rdquo; here and here.)</p><p>And then there are questions of &ldquo;How to think&rdquo; that seem not quite answered by either probability theory or decision theory - like the question of how to feel about the truth once we have it. Here again, trying to define &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; a particular way doesn&rsquo;t support an answer, merely presume it.</p><h3 id=from-the-twelve-virtues-of-rationality>From the Twelve Virtues of Rationality</h3><blockquote><p>How can you improve your conception of rationality? Not by saying to yourself, &ldquo;It is my duty to be rational.&rdquo; By this you only enshrine your mistaken conception. Perhaps your conception of rationality is that it is rational to believe the words of the Great Teacher, and the Great Teacher says, &ldquo;The sky is green,&rdquo; and you look up at the sky and see blue. If you think: &ldquo;It may look like the sky is blue, but rationality is to believe the words of the Great Teacher,&rdquo; you lose a chance to discover your mistake.</p><p>Do not ask whether it is &ldquo;the Way&rdquo; to do this or that. Ask whether the sky is blue or green. If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.</p><p>You may try to name the highest principle with names such as &ldquo;the map that reflects the territory&rdquo; or &ldquo;experience of success and failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bayesian decision theory&rdquo;. But perhaps you describe incorrectly the nameless virtue. How will you discover your mistake? Not by comparing your description to itself, but by comparing it to that which you did not name.</p></blockquote><p>We are not here to argue the meaning of a word, not even if that word is &ldquo;rationality&rdquo;. The point of attaching sequences of letters to particular concepts is to let two people communicate - to help transport thoughts from one mind to another. You cannot change reality, or prove the thought, by manipulating which meanings go with which words.</p><p>So if you understand what concept we are generally getting at with this word &ldquo;rationality&rdquo;, and with the sub-terms &ldquo;epistemic rationality&rdquo; and &ldquo;instrumental rationality&rdquo;, we have communicated: we have accomplished everything there is to accomplish by talking about how to define &ldquo;rationality&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s left to discuss is not what meaning to attach to the syllables &ldquo;ra-tio-na-li-ty&rdquo;; what&rsquo;s left to discuss is what is a good way to think.</p><p>With that said, you should be aware that many of us will regard as controversial - at the very least - any construal of &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; that makes it non-normative:</p><p>For example, if you say, &ldquo;The rational belief is X, but the true belief is Y&rdquo; then you are probably using the word &ldquo;rational&rdquo; in a way that means something other than what most of us have in mind. (E.g. some of us expect &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; to be consistent under reflection - &ldquo;rationally&rdquo; looking at the evidence, and &ldquo;rationally&rdquo; considering how your mind processes the evidence, shouldn&rsquo;t lead to two different conclusions.) Similarly, if you find yourself saying &ldquo;The rational thing to do is X, but the right thing to do is Y&rdquo; then you are almost certainly using one of the words &ldquo;rational&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo; in a way that a huge chunk of readers won&rsquo;t agree with.</p><p>In this case - or in any other case where controversy threatens - you should substitute more specific language: &ldquo;The self-benefiting thing to do is to run away, but I hope I would at least try to drag the girl off the railroad tracks&rdquo; or &ldquo;Causal decision theory as usually formulated says you should two-box on Newcomb&rsquo;s Problem, but I&rsquo;d rather have a million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;X is rational!&rdquo; is usually just a more strident way of saying &ldquo;I think X is true&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think X is good&rdquo;. So why have an additional word for &ldquo;rational&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;good&rdquo;? Because we want to talk about systematic methods for obtaining truth and winning.</p><p>The word &ldquo;rational&rdquo; has potential pitfalls, but there are plenty of non-borderline cases where &ldquo;rational&rdquo; works fine to communicate what one is getting at, likewise &ldquo;irrational&rdquo;. In these cases we&rsquo;re not afraid to use it.</p><p>Yet one should also be careful not to overuse that word. One receives no points merely for pronouncing it loudly. If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.</p><h2 id=why-truth-and>Why Truth? And&mldr;</h2><p>Some of the comments in this blog have touched on the question of why we ought to seek truth. (Thankfully not many have questioned what truth is.) Our shaping motivation for configuring our thoughts to rationality, which determines whether a given configuration is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, comes from whyever we wanted to find truth in the first place.</p><p>It is written: &ldquo;The first virtue is curiosity.&rdquo; Curiosity is one reason to seek truth, and it may not be the only one, but it has a special and admirable purity. If your motive is curiosity, you will assign priority to questions according to how the questions, themselves, tickle your personal aesthetic sense. A trickier challenge, with a greater probability of failure, may be worth more effort than a simpler one, just because it is more fun.</p><p>Some people, I suspect, may object that curiosity is an emotion and is therefore &ldquo;not rational&rdquo;. I label an emotion as &ldquo;not rational&rdquo; if it rests on mistaken beliefs, or rather, on irrational epistemic conduct: &ldquo;If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is hot, and it is cool, the Way opposes your fear. If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is cool, and it is hot, the Way opposes your calm.&rdquo; Conversely, then, an emotion which is evoked by correct beliefs or epistemically rational thinking is a &ldquo;rational emotion&rdquo;; and this has the advantage of letting us regard calm as an emotional state, rather than a privileged default. When people think of &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; and &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; as opposed, I suspect that they are really thinking of System 1 and System 2 - fast perceptual judgments versus slow deliberative judgments. Deliberative judgments aren&rsquo;t always true, and perceptual judgments aren&rsquo;t always false; so it is very important to distinguish that dichotomy from &ldquo;rationality&rdquo;. Both systems can serve the goal of truth, or defeat it, according to how they are used.</p><p>Besides sheer emotional curiosity, what other motives are there for desiring truth? Well, you might want to accomplish some specific real-world goal, like building an airplane, and therefore you need to know some specific truth about aerodynamics. Or more mundanely, you want chocolate milk, and therefore you want to know whether the local grocery has chocolate milk, so you can choose whether to walk there or somewhere else. If this is the reason you want truth, then the priority you assign to your questions will reflect the expected utility of their information - how much the possible answers influence your choices, how much your choices matter, and how much you expect to find an answer that changes your choice from its default.</p><p>To seek truth merely for its instrumental value may seem impure - should we not desire the truth for its own sake? - but such investigations are extremely important because they create an outside criterion of verification: if your airplane drops out of the sky, or if you get to the store and find no chocolate milk, it&rsquo;s a hint that you did something wrong. You get back feedback on which modes of thinking work, and which don&rsquo;t. Pure curiosity is a wonderful thing, but it may not linger too long on verifying its answers, once the attractive mystery is gone. Curiosity, as a human emotion, has been around since long before the ancient Greeks. But what set humanity firmly on the path of Science was noticing that certain modes of thinking uncovered beliefs that let us manipulate the world. As far as sheer curiosity goes, spinning campfire tales of gods and heroes satisfied that desire just as well, and no one realized that anything was wrong with that.</p><p>Are there motives for seeking truth besides curiosity and pragmatism? The third reason that I can think of is morality: You believe that to seek the truth is noble and important and worthwhile. Though such an ideal also attaches an intrinsic value to truth, it&rsquo;s a very different state of mind from curiosity. Being curious about what&rsquo;s behind the curtain doesn&rsquo;t feel the same as believing that you have a moral duty to look there. In the latter state of mind, you are a lot more likely to believe that someone else should look behind the curtain, too, or castigate them if they deliberately close their eyes. For this reason, I would also label as &ldquo;morality&rdquo; the belief that truthseeking is pragmatically important to society, and therefore is incumbent as a duty upon all. Your priorities, under this motivation, will be determined by your ideals about which truths are most important (not most useful or most intriguing); or your moral ideals about when, under what circumstances, the duty to seek truth is at its strongest.</p><p>I tend to be suspicious of morality as a motivation for rationality, not because I reject the moral ideal, but because it invites certain kinds of trouble. It is too easy to acquire, as learned moral duties, modes of thinking that are dreadful missteps in the dance. Consider Mr. Spock of Star Trek, a naive archetype of rationality. Spock&rsquo;s emotional state is always set to &ldquo;calm&rdquo;, even when wildly inappropriate. He often gives many significant digits for probabilities that are grossly uncalibrated. (E.g: &ldquo;Captain, if you steer the Enterprise directly into that black hole, our probability of surviving is only 2.234%&rdquo; Yet nine times out of ten the Enterprise is not destroyed. What kind of tragic fool gives four significant digits for a figure that is off by two orders of magnitude?) Yet this popular image is how many people conceive of the duty to be &ldquo;rational&rdquo; - small wonder that they do not embrace it wholeheartedly. To make rationality into a moral duty is to give it all the dreadful degrees of freedom of an arbitrary tribal custom. People arrive at the wrong answer, and then indignantly protest that they acted with propriety, rather than learning from their mistake.</p><p>And yet if we&rsquo;re going to improve our skills of rationality, go beyond the standards of performance set by hunter-gatherers, we&rsquo;ll need deliberate beliefs about how to think with propriety. When we write new mental programs for ourselves, they start out in System 2, the deliberate system, and are only slowly - if ever - trained into the neural circuitry that underlies System 1. So if there are certain kinds of thinking that we find we want to avoid - like, say, biases - it will end up represented, within System 2, as an injunction not to think that way; a professed duty of avoidance.</p><p>If we want the truth, we can most effectively obtain it by thinking in certain ways, rather than others; and these are the techniques of rationality. Some of the techniques of rationality involve overcoming a certain class of obstacles, the biases&mldr;</p><h2 id=whats-a-bias-again>What&rsquo;s a Bias Again?</h2><p>A bias is a certain kind of obstacle to our goal of obtaining truth - its character as an &ldquo;obstacle&rdquo; stems from this goal of truth - but there are many obstacles that are not &ldquo;biases&rdquo;.</p><p>If we start right out by asking &ldquo;What is bias?&rdquo;, it comes at the question in the wrong order. As the proverb goes, &ldquo;There are forty kinds of lunacy but only one kind of common sense.&rdquo; The truth is an arrow target, a small region of configuration space to hit. &ldquo;She loves me, she loves me not&rdquo; may be a binary question, but E=MC² is a tiny dot in the space of all equations, like a winning lottery ticket in the space of all lottery tickets. Error is not an exceptional condition; it is success which is a priori so improbable that it requires an explanation.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t start out with a moral duty to &ldquo;reduce bias&rdquo;, because biases are bad and evil and Just Not Done. This is the sort of thinking someone might end up with if they acquired a deontological duty of &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; by social osmosis, which leads to people trying to execute techniques without appreciating the reason for them. (Which is bad and evil and Just Not Done, according to Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman, which I read as a kid.)</p><p>Rather, we want to get to the truth, for whatever reason, and we find various obstacles getting in the way of our goal. These obstacles are not wholly dissimilar to each other - for example, there are obstacles that have to do with not having enough computing power available, or information being expensive. It so happens that a large group of obstacles seem to have a certain character in common - to cluster in a region of obstacle-to-truth space - and this cluster has been labeled &ldquo;biases&rdquo;.</p><p>What is a bias? Can we look at the empirical cluster and find a compact test for membership? Perhaps we will find that we can&rsquo;t really give any explanation better than pointing to a few extensional examples, and hoping the listener understands. If you are a scientist just beginning to investigate fire, it might be a lot wiser to point to a campfire and say &ldquo;Fire is that orangey-bright hot stuff over there,&rdquo; rather than saying &ldquo;I define fire as an alchemical transmutation of substances which releases phlogiston.&rdquo; As I said in The Simple Truth, you should not ignore something just because you can&rsquo;t define it. I can&rsquo;t quote the equations of General Relativity from memory, but nonetheless if I walk off a cliff, I&rsquo;ll fall. And we can say the same of biases - they won&rsquo;t hit any less hard if it turns out we can&rsquo;t define compactly what a &ldquo;bias&rdquo; is. So we might point to conjunction fallacies, to overconfidence, to the availability and representativeness heuristics, to base rate neglect, and say: &ldquo;Stuff like that.&rdquo;</p><p>With all that said, we seem to label as &ldquo;biases&rdquo; those obstacles to truth which are produced, not by the cost of information, nor by limited computing power, but by the shape of our own mental machinery. For example, the machinery is evolutionarily optimized to purposes that actively oppose epistemic accuracy; for example, the machinery to win arguments in adaptive political contexts. Or the selection pressure ran skew to epistemic accuracy; for example, believing what others believe, to get along socially. Or, in the classic heuristic-and-bias, the machinery operates by an identifiable algorithm that does some useful work but also produces systematic errors: the availability heuristic is not itself a bias, but it gives rise to identifiable, compactly describable biases. Our brains are doing something wrong, and after a lot of experimentation and/or heavy thinking, someone identifies the problem in a fashion that System 2 can comprehend; then we call it a &ldquo;bias&rdquo;. Even if we can do no better for knowing, it is still a failure that arises, in an identifiable fashion, from a particular kind of cognitive machinery - not from having too little machinery, but from the shape of the machinery itself.</p><p>&ldquo;Biases&rdquo; are distinguished from errors that arise from cognitive content, such as adopted beliefs, or adopted moral duties. These we call &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;biases&rdquo;, and they are much easier to correct, once we&rsquo;ve noticed them for ourselves. (Though the source of the mistake, or the source of the source of the mistake, may ultimately be some bias.)</p><p>&ldquo;Biases&rdquo; are distinguished from errors that arise from damage to an individual human brain, or from absorbed cultural mores; biases arise from machinery that is humanly universal.</p><p>Plato wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;biased&rdquo; because he was ignorant of General Relativity - he had no way to gather that information, his ignorance did not arise from the shape of his mental machinery. But if Plato believed that philosophers would make better kings because he himself was a philosopher - and this belief, in turn, arose because of a universal adaptive political instinct for self-promotion, and not because Plato&rsquo;s daddy told him that everyone has a moral duty to promote their own profession to governorship, or because Plato sniffed too much glue as a kid - then that was a bias, whether Plato was ever warned of it or not.</p><p>Biases may not be cheap to correct. They may not even be correctable. But where we look upon our own mental machinery and see a causal account of an identifiable class of errors; and when the problem seems to come from the evolved shape of the machinery, rather from there being too little machinery, or bad specific content; then we call that a bias.</p><p>Personally, I see our quest in terms of acquiring personal skills of rationality, in improving truthfinding technique. The challenge is to attain the positive goal of truth, not to avoid the negative goal of failure. Failure space is wide, infinite errors in infinite variety. It is difficult to describe so huge a space: &ldquo;What is true of one apple may not be true of another apple; thus more can be said about a single apple than about all the apples in the world.&rdquo; Success-space is narrower, and therefore more can be said about it.</p><p>While I am not averse (as you can see) to discussing definitions, we should remember that is not our primary goal. We are here to pursue the great human quest for truth: for we have desperate need of the knowledge, and besides, we&rsquo;re curious. To this end let us strive to overcome whatever obstacles lie in our way, whether we call them &ldquo;biases&rdquo; or not.</p><h2 id=what-is-evidence>What is Evidence?</h2><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The sentence &lsquo;snow is white&rsquo; is true if and only if snow is white.&rdquo;</p><p>— Alfred Tarski</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;To say of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not, is true.&rdquo;</p><p>— Aristotle, Metaphysics IV</p></blockquote><p>If these two quotes don&rsquo;t seem like a sufficient definition of &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, read this. Today I&rsquo;m going to talk about &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;. (I also intend to discuss beliefs-of-fact, not emotions or morality, as distinguished here.)</p><p>Walking along the street, your shoelaces come untied. Shortly thereafter, for some odd reason, you start believing your shoelaces are untied. Light leaves the Sun and strikes your shoelaces and bounces off; some photons enter the pupils of your eyes and strike your retina; the energy of the photons triggers neural impulses; the neural impulses are transmitted to the visual-processing areas of the brain; and there the optical information is processed and reconstructed into a 3D model that is recognized as an untied shoelace. There is a sequence of events, a chain of cause and effect, within the world and your brain, by which you end up believing what you believe. The final outcome of the process is a state of mind which mirrors the state of your actual shoelaces.</p><p>What is evidence? It is an event entangled, by links of cause and effect, with whatever you want to know about. If the target of your inquiry is your shoelaces, for example, then the light entering your pupils is evidence entangled with your shoelaces. This should not be confused with the technical sense of &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; used in physics - here I&rsquo;m just talking about &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; in the sense of two things that end up in correlated states because of the links of cause and effect between them.</p><p>Not every influence creates the kind of &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; required for evidence. It&rsquo;s no help to have a machine that beeps when you enter winning lottery numbers, if the machine also beeps when you enter losing lottery numbers. The light reflected from your shoes would not be useful evidence about your shoelaces, if the photons ended up in the same physical state whether your shoelaces were tied or untied.</p><p>To say it abstractly: For an event to be evidence about a target of inquiry, it has to happen differently in a way that&rsquo;s entangled with the different possible states of the target. (To say it technically: There has to be Shannon mutual information between the evidential event and the target of inquiry, relative to your current state of uncertainty about both of them.)</p><p>Entanglement can be contagious when processed correctly, which is why you need eyes and a brain. If photons reflect off your shoelaces and hit a rock, the rock won&rsquo;t change much. The rock won&rsquo;t reflect the shoelaces in any helpful way; it won&rsquo;t be detectably different depending on whether your shoelaces were tied or untied. This is why rocks are not useful witnesses in court. A photographic film will contract shoelace-entanglement from the incoming photons, so that the photo can itself act as evidence. If your eyes and brain work correctly, you will become tangled up with your own shoelaces.</p><p>This is why rationalists put such a heavy premium on the paradoxical-seeming claim that a belief is only really worthwhile if you could, in principle, be persuaded to believe otherwise. If your retina ended up in the same state regardless of what light entered it, you would be blind. Some belief systems, in a rather obvious trick to reinforce themselves, say that certain beliefs are only really worthwhile if you believe them unconditionally - no matter what you see, no matter what you think. Your brain is supposed to end up in the same state regardless. Hence the phrase, &ldquo;blind faith&rdquo;. If what you believe doesn&rsquo;t depend on what you see, you&rsquo;ve been blinded as effectively as by poking out your eyeballs.</p><p>If your eyes and brain work correctly, your beliefs will end up entangled with the facts. Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence. If your tongue speaks truly, your rational beliefs, which are themselves evidence, can act as evidence for someone else. Entanglement can be transmitted through chains of cause and effect - and if you speak, and another hears, that too is cause and effect. When you say &ldquo;My shoelaces are untied&rdquo; over a cellphone, you&rsquo;re sharing your entanglement with your shoelaces with a friend.</p><p>Therefore rational beliefs are contagious, among honest folk who believe each other to be honest. And it&rsquo;s why a claim that your beliefs are not contagious - that you believe for private reasons which are not transmissible - is so suspicious. If your beliefs are entangled with reality, they should be contagious among honest folk.</p><p>If your model of reality suggests that the outputs of your thought processes should not be contagious to others, then your model says that your beliefs are not themselves evidence, meaning they are not entangled with reality. You should apply a reflective correction, and stop believing.</p><p>Indeed, if you feel, on a gut level, what this all means, you <em>will automatically</em> stop believing. Because &ldquo;my belief is not entangled with reality&rdquo; means &ldquo;my belief is not accurate&rdquo;. As soon as you stop believing &ldquo;&lsquo;snow is white&rsquo; is true&rdquo;, you should (automatically!) stop believing &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;, or something is very wrong.</p><p>So go ahead and explain why the kind of thought processes you use systematically produce beliefs that mirror reality. Explain why you think you&rsquo;re rational. Why you think that, using thought processes like the ones you use, minds will end up believing &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo; if and only if snow is white. If you don&rsquo;t believe that the outputs of your thought processes are entangled with reality, why do you believe the outputs of your thought processes? It&rsquo;s the same thing, or it should be.</p><h2 id=how-much-evidence-does-it-take>How Much Evidence Does It Take?</h2><p>Previously, I defined evidence as &ldquo;an event entangled, by links of cause and effect, with whatever you want to know about&rdquo;, and entangled as &ldquo;happening differently for different possible states of the target&rdquo;. So how much entanglement - how much evidence - is required to support a belief?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with a question simple enough to be mathematical: how hard would you have to entangle yourself with the lottery in order to win? Suppose there are seventy balls, drawn without replacement, and six numbers to match for the win.
